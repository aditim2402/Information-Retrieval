No prior computer programming experience is required and only a basic knowledge of computers is assumed.  The material covered will enable you to write simple computer programs to solve engineering problems in elementary courses.  All programming is done in FORTRAN.  This course is intended for students who received little or no programming instruction in high school.\\n\\nThis section is taught entirely in the FORTRAN programming language and is intended primarily for engineering students and non-computer science majors.

This course is Pass/Fail only.  You must complete and hand in all five assignments to be eligible to pass the course.  There are no tests or exams.\\n\\n\\t100% - Assignments (4 @ 25% each)\\n\\nClick here to see a list of the current class grades for Section 1 (identifed by student ID only).\\nClick here to see a list of the current class grades Section 2 (identifed by student ID only).\\n\\n Syllabus (tentative)\\n\\nThe following topics and sections of the text will be approximately covered each week during the semester.  You will only get the most out of this class if you read the relevant sections of the text before coming to class.  This way you will be able to ask questions in class about anything that you are unsure of, instead of waiting until you\\'re in the lab trying to work on an assignment to discover you didn\\'t really understand something.\\n\\nWeeks 1-8\\n\\n\\n Text and Lecture Notes\\nText:\\nFortran with Engineering Applications, 5th. edition, by E. Koffman and F. Friedman, 1993.\\nLecture Notes:\\nCopies of the lecture notes will be available on-line at the end of each week of class. Important - the on-line lecture notes are not a substitute for coming to class and only cover what I show on the overhead projector.  They do not include any examples or additional notes that I put on the board.  You are responsible for all the material covered in class.\\n\\nWeek 1\\nWeek 2\\nWeek 3\\nWeek 4\\nWeek 5\\nWeek 6\\nWeek 7\\nWeek 8\\n\\n\\n Programming Assignments\\n\\nThere are four programming assignments each contributing 25% to your final grade.  You must attempt to complete every programming assignment.  If you hand in a program that does not run or will not even compile without errors then it will not be graded and will automatically receive a zero grade and you risk failing the course.\\n\\nGradesheets\\nHandin Directory (how to hand in assignments online)\\n   Late Policy\\nPolicy on Academic Misconduct (i.e. cheating)\\n\\nAssignment Specifications:\\n\\nProgram #0 (handed out in class), due Wednesday 3/27/96, 8:50 am\\n   Program #1, due Monday 4/8/96, 8:50 am\\n   Program #2, due Friday 4/19/96, 8:50 am\\n   Program #3, due Wednesday 5/1/96, 8:50 am\\n   Program #4, due Friday 5/10/96, 1:00 pm\\n\\nHow to Get Help with Your Assignments:\\n\\nConsultants: \\n   The consultants in the computer lab can help you with most problems.  They wear name tags and are on duty from approximately 8:00 am to 11:00 pm.  Consultants can answer short questions about compiler error messages and program syntax, as well as how to login, use the printers, send E-mail, run Netscape, etc.\\n\\nClick here for more information about the consultants.\\n   \\n\\nInstructor:\\n   General questions about an assignment or questions that may require a long explanation are best answered by myself.  Please see me during office hours or send me E-mail.  I am not normally in my office except during office hours because I do my dissertation research from home via a modem.  Therefore, if you want to see me outside of office hours please make an appointment first.  You can most easily contact me by E-mail because I regularly login and read my E-mail from home.\\n\\nClick here to send me E-mail.\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n Problem Solving Exercises\\n\\nOne of the most important skills you will learn in this class is problem solving.  Good problem solving skills distinguish a \"good\" computer programmer from a \"bad\" one - it doesn\\'t matter how familiar or skilled you are in a particular programming language, if you do not understand how to solve the problem then you will not be able to write a computer program for it in any language.\\n\\nTo help you learn problem solving skills and techniques I will assign weekly problem solving exercises.  These will be small but non-trivial problems which I will give out each Monday.  You should look at the problem and think about it during the week and right down the steps you would go through to solve the problem; i.e. the overall structure of your program.  This is primarily an exercise in general problem solving so you do not have to write any FORTRAN code (though you may if you want to and have time) and your solution/algorithm should not even be dependent on a particular programming language such as FORTRAN.  We will go over the solution in class the following Monday.\\nExercises:\\n\\nWeek 2: Question 16, Pg. 89. Click here for the solution.\\n   Week 3: Question 4, Pg. 147. Click here for the solution.\\n   Week 4: Question 13, Pg. 218. Click here for the solution.\\n   Week 5: Question 6, Pg. 269. Click here for the solution.\\n   Week 6: Question 10, Pg. 329 (subroutines) - click here for the solution; Question 11, Pg. 330 (functions) - click here for the solution.\\n   Week 7: Question 8, Pg. 401. Click here for the solution.\\n\\n\\n Computer Lab\\n\\nYou will be using the Vectra lab in Rm. 1350 Computer Science & Statistics containing Hewlett-Packard Vectra\\'s running Microsoft Windows and Microsoft FORTRAN.  This lab is open from 7:00 am to 1:00 am seven days a week except certain holidays.  The printer room is located across the hall in Rm. 1359.\\n\\nYou may also use your home or dorm computers to write your programs, however you will probably have to purchase your own copy of Microsoft FORTRAN or Lahey Personal FORTRAN (see the inside cover of the textbook).  You may also work in any of the other computer labs on campus, however most do not have FORTRAN compilers (please see me first before using the CAE lab).\\n\\nThe software you will be using in the lab includes:\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows and MS-DOS\\nE-mail\\nNetscape\\n\\n\\n Other Pointers of Interest\\n\\n CS 110 Home Page\\n Gareth Bestor\\'s Home Page\\n Computer Sciences Department Home Page\\n Starting Points for Internet Exploration\\n Lycos (search the World-Wide-Web by keyword)\\n   \\n Dilbert (comic relief for those long nights before an assignment is due)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCopyright © 1996 Gareth S.

No prior computer programming experience is required and only a basic knowledge of computers is assumed.  The material covered will enable you to write simple computer programs to solve engineering problems in elementary courses.  All programming is done in FORTRAN.  This course is intended for students who received little or no programming instruction in high school.\\n\\nThis section is taught entirely in the FORTRAN programming language and is intended primarily for engineering students and non-computer science majors.

This course is Credit/No Credit only. There are no tests or exams.\\n\\n\\t100% - Assignments (4 @ 24% each + 1 for 4%)\\n\\n\\n Syllabus (tentative)\\n\\nThe following topics and sections of the text will be approximately covered each week during the semester.  You will only get the most out of this class if you read the relevant sections of the text before coming to class.  This way you will be able to ask questions in class about anything that you are unsure of, instead of waiting until you\\'re in the lab trying to work on an assignment to discover you didn\\'t really understand something.\\n\\nWeeks 1-8\\n\\n\\n Text and Lecture Notes\\nText:\\nFortran with Engineering Applications, 5th. edition, by E. Koffman and F. Friedman, 1993.\\nLecture Notes:\\nCopies of the lecture notes will be available on-line at the end of each week of class. Important - the on-line lecture notes are not a substitute for coming to class.  They do not include any examples or additional notes that I put on the board (except for Week1).  You are responsible for all the material covered in class.\\n\\nWeek1\\nWeek2\\n\\n\\n Programming Assignments\\n\\nThere are four programming assignments each contributing 25% to your final grade.  You must attempt to complete every programming assignment.  If you hand in a program that does not run or will not even compile without errors then it will get a very low mark (check the gradesheets) and you risk failing the course.\\n\\nGradesheets\\nWhat to do in DOS/Fortran (and how to hand in assignments online)\\n   Late Policy\\nPolicy on Academic Misconduct (i.e. cheating)\\n\\nAssignment Specifications:\\n\\nProgram0, due Friday 11/1/96, 5:00pm\\n   Program1, due Wednesday 11/13/96, 5:00pm\\n\\nHow to Get Help with Your Assignments:\\n\\nConsultants: \\n   The consultants in the computer lab can help you with most problems.  They wear name tags and are on duty from approximately 8:00 am to 11:00 pm.  Consultants can answer short questions about compiler error messages and program syntax, as well as how to login, use the printers, send E-mail, run Netscape, etc.\\n\\nClick here for more information about the consultants.\\n   \\n\\nInstructor:\\n   General questions about an assignment or questions that may require a long explanation are best answered by myself.  Please see me during office hours or send me E-mail.  I am not normally in my office except during office hours because I do my research from home via a modem.  Therefore, if you want to see me outside of office hours please make an appointment first.  You can most easily contact me by E-mail because I regularly login and read my E-mail from home. If you mail from Netscape, make sure to include your name and e-mail address, as they don\\'t show up for me, so I won\\'t know who mailed me and be able to respond otherwise.\\n\\nClick here to send me E-mail.\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n Problem Solving Exercises\\n\\nOne of the most important skills you will learn in this class is problem solving.  Good problem solving skills distinguish a \"good\" computer programmer from a \"bad\" one - it doesn\\'t matter how familiar or skilled you are in a particular programming language, if you do not understand how to solve the problem then you will not be able to write a computer program for it in any language.\\n\\nTo help you learn problem solving skills and techniques I will assign weekly problem solving exercises.  These will be small but non-trivial problems which I will give out each Monday.  You should look at the problem and think about it during the week and right down the steps you would go through to solve the problem; i.e. the overall structure of your program.  This is primarily an exercise in general problem solving so you do not have to write any FORTRAN code (though you may if you want to and have time) and your solution/algorithm should not even be dependent on a particular programming language such as FORTRAN.  We will go over the solution in class the following Monday.\\nExercises:\\n\\n\\n\\n Computer Lab\\n\\nYou will be using the Vectra lab in Rm. 1350 Computer Science & Statistics containing Hewlett-Packard Vectra\\'s running Microsoft Windows and Microsoft FORTRAN.  This lab is open from 7:00 am to 1:00 am seven days a week except certain holidays.  The printer room is located across the hall in Rm. 1359. You have a quota of 300 pages on which\\n to print. Once you exceed that quota you must contact the lab either by e-mail or by going to room 2310 during office hours (they prefer e-mail) to pay to increase your quota.\\nBeware: Some of the machines in the Vectra lab aren\\'t configured correctly. In particular, the machines along the wall closest to the outside\\nhallway, towards the left-hand part of the room. Try to avoid those if you can.\\nYou may also use your home or dorm computers to write your programs, however you will probably have to purchase your own copy of Microsoft FORTRAN or Lahey Personal FORTRAN (see the inside cover of the textbook).  You may also work in any of the other computer labs on campus, however most do not have FORTRAN compilers (please see me first before using the CAE lab).\\n\\nThe software you will be using in the lab includes:\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows and MS-DOS\\nE-mail\\nNetscape\\n\\n\\n Other Pointers of Interest\\n\\n CS 110 Home Page\\n Jeff Lampert\\'s Home Page\\n Computer Sciences Department Home Page\\n Starting Points for Internet Exploration\\n Lycos (search the World-Wide-Web by keyword)\\n   \\n Dilbert (comic relief for those long nights before an assignment is due)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCopyright © 1996 Modified from Gareth S.

We will discuss how computers work,\\nincluding the following topics (not necessarily in this order):\\n\\napplication programs (including word processors, spreadsheets, graphics\\n  and databases) \\nhardware, input/output, storage devices \\noperating systems, programming languages \\nnetworks and telecommunications \\nartificial intelligence and expert systems \\ncomputer-related social issues \\n\\nPart 2 - Lab:\\nIn the laboratory (discussion) sections you will have hands-on experience\\non Macintosh IIci computers with the following programs:\\n\\nword processing (MS Word 5.0) \\nelectronic mail, newsgroups, and World Wide Web (Eudora 3.0 and\\n  Netscape 3.0) \\npainting and drawing (Aldus SuperPaint 3.0) \\nspreadsheet and charting (MS Excel 5.0) \\ndatabase (FileMaker) \\npresentation manager (HyperCard 2.1) \\ndesktop publishing (Aldus PageMaker 4.0) \\n\\nAn integral part of lab is learning the Macintosh operating system (System\\n7.5.3) as well.\\nIn addition, there are some special tools (CD-ROM and scanners) available.\\nThere are 10 TAs that teach the lab sections. Both the TAs and I have the\\ngoal of providing you with high quality instruction and a rich educational\\nexperience.\\nTAs:\\n\\n\\nName\\nSection\\nTime\\nDays \\n\\nJon Bodner \\n358\\n6:10\\nMW\\n\\nNick Leavy\\n338\\n340\\n3:30\\n11:00\\nMW\\nTR\\n\\nShannon Lloyd \\n354\\n356\\n5:20\\n6:40\\nTR\\nTR\\n\\nJeff Reminga\\n331\\n357\\n7:45\\n4:50\\nMWF\\nMW\\n\\nIra Sharenow\\n351\\n352\\n1:00\\n2:30\\nTR\\nTR\\n\\nBrian Swander\\n\\n335\\n336\\n12:05\\n1:20\\nMWF\\nMWF\\n\\nBrad Thayer \\n333\\n334\\n9:55\\n11:00\\nMWF\\nMWF\\n\\nJoe Varghese\\n339\\n355\\n9:30\\n8:00\\nTR\\nTR\\n\\nGeoff Weinberg\\n337\\n353\\n2:25\\n4:00\\nMWF\\nTR\\n\\nMaria Yuin\\n332\\n359\\n8:50\\n7:30\\nMWF\\nMW\\n\\n\\nRecommended Background:\\nNo background is necessary for this course.\\nAssignments, Quizzes and Exams:\\nYour grade will be based on two exams from lecture, and on regular assignments\\nand quizzes in lab.\\nSyllabus:\\nTo glance at the syllabus (which contains all nitty-gritty class details),\\nclick here. \\nAssignments:\\nAssignment 3: SuperPaint\\nAssignment 4: Excel\\nLast modified: October 13, 1996 by Jon\\nBodner\\n\\n\\n'}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cs.wisc.edu^~hcl^cs302', 'pagename': \"CS302-13:  Class Home Page, Fall '96\", 'content': 'Date: Mon, 11 Nov 1996 16:00:51 GMT\\nServer: NCSA/1.5\\nContent-type: text/html\\nLast-modified: Tue, 05 Nov 1996 17:20:57 GMT\\nContent-length: 5645\\n\\n\\n\\nCS302-13:  Class Home Page, Fall \\'96\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCS302\\n    : Algebraic Language Programming in C++\\nSection 13, Fall 1996\\nTA: H. Chad Lane\\n[hcl@cs.wisc.edu]\\n\\n\\nAnnouncements:\\n\\n Program 7 is on-line and due Tues Nov 12. \\n   IMPORTANT!  You need to get the \\n       new version of tribble.h (as of 11/4) before you compile.  The \\n       problem was that the enumerated types were not recognized outside of\\n       the class.  They must be declared inside the public section of the class.\\n       As a result, the private section at the top needed to bumped down to the\\n       private section at the bottom.  This is shown in the new version.\\n       Also note the definition of the RandomIntInRange() is\\n       defined in-line so that you will not need a corresponding \\n       function body in tribble.cpp.  You can just call it from within the\\n       class, and it will work.\\n In the file \"prog06.cpp\" I forgot to change the enumerated\\n     type values to uppercase.  You need to do this before you\\n     compile everything.  I have changed the \\n     on-line copy of prog06.cpp if you just want to overwrite your\\n     obsolete copy.  Also, it used to say \"#include prog05.h\", so I changed\\n     it to \"prog06.h\"\\n   You might also want to check the help link below again... something\\n       was added.\\n   Here are some Comments and\\n       Suggestions for Program 6.  \\n   It is very important that you use the same name throughout\\n       program 6 for the project parts (name of the project, \\n       directory name, file names, etc.).  I updated the program\\n       description to be consistent with \"prog06.\"  If you saw\\n       the old version (that used \"prog05\"), please make sure\\n       you are consistent with your naming.  The only discrepency\\n       is with the sample run in Chris Weaver\\'s public directory\\n       where it is called prog05, but this shouldn\\'t matter for \\n       your program (it is just a sample).\\n   Program 6 is on-line and ready.  It is crucial that you read\\n       the entire assignment and understand class basics before you\\n       attempt it, and that you get an early start.  It is not \\n       hard, but will require some time to piece everything \\n       together.  Bring questions to class on Tuesday!\\n   About midterm grades for freshmen...  you either got a B (which\\n     means your doing fine), or a D (which means you\\'re not doing so\\n     great).  It is a thumbs up or down grade, and means nothing more\\n     than that.  If you\\'re not a freshman, disregard this.\\n\\n\\nStuff For, From, and About class:\\n\\n Tentative semester syllabus/reading assignments\\n Programming assignments\\n Handouts\\n Preparing for Quizzes and Tests\\n Old Quizzes & Tests w/solutions\\n\\n\\nCourse Information & Policies:\\n\\nText: \\nProblem Solving with C++:  The Object of Programming, \\n  Walter Savitch, \\n  Addison Wesley Publishing Company, Inc., 1996.\\n  We meet in B139 Van Vleck on T Th, 1:00pm - 2:15pm.          \\n  Policies and Administrative Information:\\n  \\nGrading Policy\\nLate Policy\\nE-mail Information\\nAttendance Policy\\nAcademic Misconduct\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Links to other 302 information:\\n\\n \\n       Introduction to Microsoft Windows (Do this first)\\n   \\n       Introduction to Borland C++ 4.5 (Do this second)\\n   CS302 home page\\n \\n       The Vectra Lab\\n Source code from the text\\n Who are\\n  consultants and what do they do?\\n Extra C++ \\n  reference material\\n CS302 FAQ (many\\n       of your questions will be answered here)\\n   Working from home\\n \\n       Some very Sharp lecture notes\\n \\n       A very Sharp style guide\\n\\n\\nLast Modified:\\n\\n\\nWed Oct 30 16:00 CDT 1996\\nby H.

Your highest two exam scores will each contribute 25% to your final grade; your lowest exam score will contribute 15%.  You must complete and hand in all the assignments to be eligible to receive a passing grade for the course.  Final grades for all CS 302 sections are graded on a curve with a mean in the range of 2.8 - 3.0, where A = 4.0; the curve is computed after the final exam is completed.\\n\\nExam 1\\n   Thur February 29, 7:15 - 9:15 pm\\n\\n   Exam 2\\n   Wed April 10, 7:15 - 9:15 pm, Rm. 1207 Computer Science\\n\\n   Final \\n   Mon May 13, 7:55 - 9:45 am\\n\\n\\nClick here to see a list of the current class grades (identifed by student ID only).\\n\\n Syllabus (tentative)\\n\\nThe following topics and sections of the text will be approximately covered each week during the semester.  You will only get the most out of this class if you read the relevant sections of the text before coming to class.  This way you will be able to ask questions in class about anything that you are unsure of, instead of waiting until you\\'re in the lab trying to work on an assignment to discover you didn\\'t really understand something.\\n\\nWeeks 1-6 (Mid-Term Exam #1)\\n   Weeks 7-11 (Mid-Term Exam #2)\\n   Weeks 12-15 (Final Exam)\\n\\n\\n Text and Lecture Notes\\nText:\\nFortran with Engineering Applications, 5th. edition, by E. Koffman and F. Friedman, 1993.\\nLecture Notes:\\nCopies of the lecture notes will be available on-line at the end of each week of class. IMPORTANT - the on-line lecture notes are not a substitute for coming to class and only cover what I show on the overhead projector.  They do not include any examples or additional notes that I put on the board.  You are responsible for all the material covered in class.\\n\\nWeek 1\\nWeek 2\\nWeek 3\\nWeek 4\\nWeek 5\\nWeek 6\\nWeek 7\\nWeek 8\\nWeek 9\\nWeek 10\\nWeek 11\\nWeek 12\\nWeek 13\\nWeek 14\\nWeek 15\\n\\n\\n Exams and Programming Assignments\\n\\nThere are three exams: two mid-term exams and one final exam.  Exams constitute 65% of your final grade so it is very important to do well on them to ensure a good grade, regardless of your performance on the assignments.  All exams are approximately two hours long (though you may stay a bit longer if you need extra time) and are closed-book.  You only need to bring a pen or pencil to exams - calculators are not necessary or even useful.\\n\\nExam Solutions:\\n\\nMid-Term Exam #1\\nMid-Term Exam #2\\n\\n\\nThere are seven programming assignments (not including Program #0) each contributing 5% to your final grade.  All the assignments must be completed and handed in to be eligible to receive a passing grade for the course.  You must attempt to complete every programming assignment.  If you hand in a program that does not run or will not even compile without errors then it will not be graded and will automatically receive a zero grade and you risk failing the course.\\n\\nGradesheets\\nHandin Directory (how to hand in assignments online)\\n   Late Policy\\nPolicy on Academic Misconduct (i.e. cheating)\\n\\nAssignment Specifications:\\n\\nProgram #1, due Monday 2/12/15/96, 9:55 am\\n   Program #2, due Friday 2/23/96, 9:55 am\\n   Program #3, due Wednesday 3/6/96, 9:55 am\\n   Program #4, due Wednesday 3/27/96, 9:55 am\\n   Program #5, due Friday 4/12/96, 9:55 am\\n   Program #6, due Monday 4/29/96, 9:55 am\\n   Program #7, due Friday 5/10/96, 1:00 pm\\n\\nHow to Get Help with Your Assignments:\\n\\nConsultants: \\n   The consultants in the computer lab can help you with most problems.  They wear name tags and are on duty from approximately 8:00 am to 11:00 pm.  Consultants can answer short questions about compiler error messages and program syntax, as well as how to login, use the printers, send E-mail, run Netscape, etc.\\n\\nClick here for more information about the consultants.\\n   \\n\\nInstructor:\\n   General questions about an assignment or questions that may require a long explanation are best answered by myself.  Please see me during office hours or send me E-mail.  I am not normally in my office except during office hours because I do my dissertation research from home via a modem.  Therefore, if you want to see me outside of office hours please make an appointment first.  You can most easily contact me by E-mail because I regularly login and read my E-mail from home.\\n\\nClick here to send me E-mail.\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n Problem Solving Exercises\\n\\nOne of the most important skills you will learn in this class is problem solving.  Good problem solving skills distinguish a \"good\" computer programmer from a \"bad\" one - it doesn\\'t matter how familiar or skilled you are in a particular programming language, if you do not understand how to solve the problem then you will not be able to write a computer program for it in any language.\\n\\nTo help you learn problem solving skills and techniques I will assign weekly problem solving exercises.  These will be small but non-trivial problems which I will give out each Monday.  You should look at the problem and think about it during the week and right down the steps you would go through to solve the problem; i.e. the overall structure of your program.  This is primarily an exercise in general problem solving so you do not have to write any FORTRAN code (though you may if you want to and have time) and your solution/algorithm should not even be dependent on a particular programming language such as FORTRAN.  Each Friday we will go over the solution in class.\\nExercises:\\n\\nWeek 3: Question 16, Pg. 89. Click here for the solution.\\n   Week 4: Question 4, Pg. 147.

Click here for the solution.\\n   Week 13: Question 5, Pg. 655.\\n\\n\\n Computer Lab\\n\\nYou will be using the Vectra lab in Rm. 1350 Computer Science & Statistics containing Hewlett-Packard Vectra\\'s running Microsoft Windows and Microsoft FORTRAN.  This lab is open from 7:00 am to 1:00 am seven days a week except certain holidays.  The printer room is located across the hall in Rm. 1359.\\n\\nYou may also use your home or dorm computers to write your programs, however you will probably have to purchase your own copy of Microsoft FORTRAN or Lahey Personal FORTRAN (see the inside cover of the textbook).  You may also work in any of the other computer labs on campus, however most do not have FORTRAN compilers (please see me first before using the CAE lab).\\n\\nThe software you will be using in the lab includes:\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows and MS-DOS\\nE-mail\\nNetscape\\n\\n\\n Other Pointers of Interest\\n\\n CS 302 Home Page\\n Gareth Bestor\\'s Home Page\\n Computer Sciences Department Home Page\\n Starting Points for Internet Exploration\\n Lycos (search the World-Wide-Web by keyword)\\n   \\n Dilbert (comic relief for those long nights before an assignment is due)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCopyright © 1996 Gareth S.

Our lab sections are taught using Macintosh\\ncomputers, but sections using PCs are available (see CS132\\nUsing Computers - Lectures 1 &2).\\nThe course has two components:\\nPart 1 - Lecture:\\nIn the lecture we will discuss computers in \"generic\" terms,\\ni.e. general computer science topics. We will discuss how computers work,\\nincluding the following topics (not necessarily in this order):\\n\\napplication programs (including word processors, spreadsheets, graphics\\n  and databases) \\nhardware, input/output, storage devices \\noperating systems, programming languages \\nnetworks and telecommunications \\nartificial intelligence and expert systems \\ncomputer-related social issues \\n\\nPart 2 - Lab:\\nIn the laboratory (discussion) sections you will have hands-on experience\\non Macintosh IIci computers with the following programs:\\n\\nword processing (MS Word 5.0) \\nelectronic mail, newsgroups, and World Wide Web (Eudora 3.0 and\\n  Netscape 3.0) \\npainting and drawing (Aldus SuperPaint 3.0) \\nspreadsheet and charting (MS Excel 5.0) \\ndatabase (FileMaker) \\npresentation manager (HyperCard 2.1) \\ndesktop publishing (Aldus PageMaker 4.0) \\n\\nAn integral part of lab is learning the Macintosh operating system (System\\n7.5.3) as well.\\nIn addition, there are some special tools (CD-ROM and scanners) available.\\nThere are 10 TAs that teach the lab sections.

Data structures are the fundamental building \\nblocks of computer programs. By the end of the course, you should be able to identify situations in which a data structure is necessary, determine the \\nrequirements for the data structure, and select the appropriate data structure from those covered in this course.\\nReiterate the concepts of structure programming, abstract data types, and modularity. These principles, which were introduced in CS302, are essential \\nto writing clear, correct, and maintainable software. As there is a close connection between abstract data types and data structures, this course places \\na strong emphasis on applying these principles in all programming exercises.\\n\\nTeaching Assistants\\nWei Zhang and Chin Tang Chin are the teaching assistants (TAs) for\\nthis course (sections 2 and 3). They will grade your homework assignments\\nand will be happy to answer questions about the\\nassignments, or any other aspect of the course that is giving you trouble.\\nWei Zhang\\nOffice: 1343 Compuer Sciences\\nOffice hours: Wednesday 10-11, Thursday 9-10, Sunday 3-4\\nOffice phone: 262-5596 \\nEmail address: weiz@cs.wisc.edu \\nChin Tang Chin \\nOffice: 3310 Computer Sciences\\nOffice hours:  Monday 9:30-10:30am, Tuesday 2:30-3:30pm, Friday 9:30-10:30am\\nOffice phone: 262-1721 \\nEmail address:\\n cchin@cs.wisc.edu \\nHome page:\\n http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cchin/cchin.html \\n\\nText\\nThe text book for this course is Data Abstraction and Problem Solving with C++: Walls and Mirrors by Frank M. Carrano (ISBN # 0-8053-1226-9). \\nThis is a well-written, if a little long-winded, text that covers most (but not all) of the material in this course. It also includes background about C++, so a \\nseparate text for the language is not necessary.\\nThe lectures will often (but not always) follow David Dewitt's CS 367 Lecture Notes - Fall 1995. These notes are far more complete that simple lecture \\nnotes, but they fall short of a true text book (they contain very little narrative text, no exercises, etc.). I am using these notes as a basis for my lectures; as \\nsuch, I feel free to skip portions and cover additional material. You may want to purchase these notes, which are available from the DoIT documentation \\ndesk at the Dayton Street entrance of the Computer Sciences building (1210 W. Dayton St). \\nIf this course is your first experience with Unix, you will need information about activating your account, logging in, creating, editing, and manipulating files, \\nand compiling, running, and debugging programs. The handout CS 1000, also available from the DoIT information desk, contains this crucial information. \\n(Also, see also the help section below.)\\nLecture Information \\nTuesday and Thursday: 11:00 - 12:30 in 107 Psychology.\\nAs mentioned above, lectures will often follow DeWitt's notes. Lecture attendence is strongly recommended as I will regularly present material that does not \\nappear in the textbook or lecture notes, but will be useful for the programming assignments and exams. Needless to say, You are responsible for all \\nmaterial covered in lecture! The exams will be based on the lecture material, reading assignments in the notes, and the course assignments.\\nElectronic Mail\\nI often use electronic mail to notify students of changes in assignments, hints for programs, etc. I assume that you regularly read your electronic mail.\\nGrading\\nThere will be one or two evening exams during the semester, a final exam and five programming assignments. The exams will determine 50% of the final \\ngrade (with approximately equal weight for each one), and the programming assignments will count for 10% each.\\nThe C++ Language \\nCS 367 will be taught using the C++ programming language, and programming assignments must be written in C++. If you do not know C++, you should \\nnot be in this section of CS367. Jim Skrentny is teaching two sections of CS367 that cover C++ in addition to data structures. C++ is a large and complex \\nlanguage; unless you are an experience programming (and even then), it is a difficult language to learn from a book.\\nThere is also another WWW page with more information on the programming assignments.\\nGdb\\nThere is also a web page that describes the gdb program debugger.\\nExams \\n\\nExam 1 \\nTuesday, Oct 22, 7:15-9:15pm, 1351 Chemistry. \\nExam 2 \\nTBA \\nFinal Exam \\nWednesday, December 18th, 5:05pm-7:05pm, place TBA \\n\\nCourse Schedule \\nThe following is a rough outline of topics that will be covered in this course. A more detailed scheduled will be provided later.\\n\\n\\nTopic \\nDewitt's Notes \\n\\nIntroduction & Administration\\nBasic stuff of C++ lecture #2 \\nFunctions lecture #3 \\nPointers lecture #4 \\nRecords & dynamic storagelecture #5 \\nLists lecture #6\\nBinary Search and O notation \\nAdvanced Listslecture #7\\nStackslecture #8 \\nQueueslecture #9\\nHashinglecture #10\\n(Evening Exam)lecture #11 \\nRecursionlecture #12 \\nTrees\\nBinary Trees - Sort & Searchlecture #13\\nAVL Trees\\nGraphslecture #16\\n(Evening Exam)\\nSortinglecture #17\\nTBA\\n\\n\\nAssignment 0\\nThis is an absolute requirement to get a grade other than F! Turn in an index card with the following information:\\n\\nName and login name\\nYear in school (freshman, sophomore, ...)\\nPrevious CS courses\\nPrevious programming experience\\nRecent photograph of you. It should not be your picture from your 1st birthday, nor from that boy/girl scout trip in the summer of 1984. It can be \\ncolor or black-and-white, any size, etc. No CS367 grades will be given without a photo! \\n\\nAssignment 1\\nThe first programming assignment is to write a simple abstract data byte for\\na bounded integer sequence.  The text of the assignment is \\non-line.\\n\\nAssignment 2\\nThe second programming assignment is to write a program to maintain a database\\nof scores for a tennis tournament.  The text of the assignment is \\non-line.\\n\\nAssignment 3\\nThe second programming assignment is to write a program to produce a\\nconcordance using hash tables.  The text of the assignment is \\non-line.\\n\\n\\n\"}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cs.wisc.edu^~deboor^cs412', 'pagename': 'CS412 - Introduction to Numerical Methods', 'content': \"Date: Thu, 07 Nov 1996 19:25:07 GMT\\nServer: NCSA/1.5\\nContent-type: text/html\\nLast-modified: Thu, 07 Nov 1996 16:17:18 GMT\\nContent-length: 5005\\n\\n\\n\\nCS412 - Introduction to Numerical Methods\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------> last change:  06nov96\\n                           \\nCS412 - Introduction to Numerical Methods\\nThis page contains information for the Fall 1996 CS412 course.\\n smile \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n changes on 29oct:\\nassignment 5 , due 12nov96.\\nNOTE the CHANGED DUE DATE as well as the slightly changed points for problems\\n1 and 4.\\n  diary of 29 oct  class;\\nadditional material on \\n residual and error, condition #   (29oct)\\n changes on 04nov: Rick Carl's office hour this R is 11-12.\\n list of errata for the text.\\n changes on 05nov:\\n  diary of 31 oct  class;\\n  diary of 05 nov  class;\\n changes on 06nov: useful email concerning\\n problem 3  (05nov) UPDATED 06nov.\\nSince there was a question about the computational complexity of numerical\\nanalysis algorithms, I have posted a \\n preprint, by one of the foremost\\nmathematicians of today, on that subject, for those interested in this tricky\\ntopic.\\n\\nleast-squares solution and approximation   (05nov)\\n\\n\\n\\n Time and Place:  TR 12:55 - 2:15, CS&STAT 1221\\n Lecturer: Carl de Boor. \\n  email: deboor@cs.wisc.edu \\n Office hours: WF11-12, R14:30-15:30, 7379 CS&Stat\\n\\n FINAL EXAM: Thursday 19dec, 2:45p.

This fall, CS838 is a graduate seminar that will examine Java, including the Java \\nprogramming language, network security, design of distributed applets, Java virtual machines, and Java implementations (compilers, interpreters, and special \\nhardware). Other Java-related topics are both welcome and encouraged.\\nThis course will be taugh as a research seminar. First, the professors are not Java experts, but expect to learning along with the students. What you get out of \\nthis course will be experience in studying and developing new ideas, interactioning with colleagues, and new insight into Java. We only plan to lecture for a \\nfew weeks to present an overview of Java. Then students will work on two-month-long group projects. Students will be evaluated on the oral and written \\npresentation of their project. This offering of CS 838 is NOT a core CS course.\\nBackground Material\\nThere is no text for this course, although there are countless Java books in bookstores. Most of these books were written very quickly and are very \\nsuperficial. The Addison-Wesley series is the \"official\" Sun reference books on Java and are much better than the average (but see below; many of them are \\non-line).\\nImplementation Reader\\nA collection of papers on Java implementation is available at DoIT.\\nOn-Line Documentation\\nSun maintains a web site that contains considerable Java documentation. Its URL is http://java.sun.com. This site contains considerable Java documentation, \\nincluding:\\n\\nThe Java Language Specification.\\nThe Virtual Machine Specification\\nThe Java API (Application Programmer Interface, i.e., libraries) Specification\\nJava Language Tutorial\\n\\n\\nSecurity-related papers:\\n\\n\\nDean, Felten, Wallach, \"Java Security: From HotJava to Netscape and Beyond.\\n\\nFrank Yellin, \"Low Level Security in Java.\\n\\nJavaSoft, Frequently Asked Questions - Applet Security.\\n\\nThe web also can provide a Java Development Kit for writing and running Java applications on a PC. This kit is already installed for the SPARCstations in \\nthe department (/s/java). The department also has the source to the JDK. You can also run Java applets in recent versions of Netscape and Microsoft\\'s \\nInternet Explorer.\\nSample Java applets are available from many places. Sun has a collection at: http://java.sun.com/java.sun.com/applets/index.html (that\\'s not a typo!). The \\nlargest collection of Java programs and applets appears to be at http://www.gamelan.com.\\nLecture Slides\\nPostscript of our lecture transparancies are available:\\n\\nJava Big Picture\\nJava Language Overview\\nJava Virtual Machine\\nImplementing the Java VM in Hardware?\\nJava Security\\n\\nProject\\nClick here for project assignment\\nBelow is a list of possible project topics.

Tanenbaum,\\nPrentice Hall, 1992.\\n\\n Strongly Recommended \\nThe Java Programming Language\\nby  Ken Arnold and James Gosling,\\nAddison Wesley, 1996.\\n\\n Online References \\n\\nLots of additional helpful materials about Java are available on the WEB.\\n\\nThe following references have been collected locally for fast access.\\n\\nThe Java Tutorial\\nThe Java Language Specification\\nJava API Documentation\\n\\nWatch this spot for additional links to the web.\\n\\n Projects \\n\\nThere will be five programming projects, all in the\\nJava\\nprogramming language.\\nSun SparcStation workstations running the Solaris dialect of the Unix\\noperating system are provided for your use, but you may use any\\ncomputer to which you have access that implements the Java programming\\nlanguage.\\nHowever, if you do not use the Computer Sciences Department's computers, \\nyou will be responsible for transferring any required\\ndata sets or software packages to your computer.\\n\\nThe first assignment will be an easy ``get acquainted'' exercise designed\\nto help you become familiar with the computing environment and the\\nJava language.\\nSubsequent projects will involve\\nprocess synchronization,\\nprocessor scheduling,\\ndisk scheduling,\\nand file-system implementation.\\nOn all but the first project, students will be required to work in pairs.\\nBoth members of a pair will receive the same grade on a project.\\nFeel free to discuss projects with anyone, but\\n\\nyou must not share code with anyone but your partner.\\n\\n\\nCheating will be vigorously punished.\\n\\nEnough said!\\n\\n\\nAssignments are due at the beginning of class (11 a.m.) on the date\\nindicated.\\nOver the entire semester, you have\\nthree late days\\nof credit.\\nYou can use these late days on different assignments (e.g., one day on each\\nof three assignments) or all three days on one assignment.\\nLate days may not be used for the last assignment.\\n\\n Why Java? \\n\\nMost students taking this course will be familiar with C++ but not Java.\\nWhy, then, did we choose Java?\\nThere are several arguments in favor of it.\\n\\nJava is a more congenial programming environment.\\nRuntime errors such as bad subscripts, null pointers,\\nand uninitialized variables cause exceptions caught by the language runtime\\nrather than mysterious crashes or random behavior.\\nJava Strings are much easier to use than char *\\narrays.  Garbage collected storage management is extremely handy.\\nAnd more!\\nJava is very trendy.\\nJava had caught on faster than any other new language in history.\\nMany of the reasons for Java's growing popularity have little to do with\\nthe way we will use it in this course (we will discuss these issues in class),\\nbut a byproduct of this course\\nwill be knowledge of Java, which is becoming quite a marketable commodity.\\nJava has ``operating system'' features built in.\\nIn particular, it is the first widely-used programming language with\\nlanguage-level support for concurrency (threads) and synchronization\\n(monitors).\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, switching to a new programming language is always\\na bit dislocating.\\nFortunately, there are excellent resources are available to ease the\\ntransition.\\nThe Java Programming Language\\nby Arnold and Gosling is amazingly good.\\nIt is neither an introductory programming primer (the authors assume you\\nalready know how to program)\\nnor a reference manual (although a\\nreference manual\\nis available online),\\nbut a readable introduction to the language, which takes you all to the way\\nfrom getting started to everything you need to write quite sophisticated\\nprograms in Java.\\nThis book is available at the University Bookstore.\\nYou are strongly encouraged to buy it.\\nWe have also gathered a variety of\\nother resources together, including a nice\\nonline tutorial\\nabout Java programming, and\\na reference manual\\nfor the standard class libraries you will be using.\\n\\n  Grading  \\n\\nThere will be a midterm and a final exam, each of which will count for 25%\\nof your grade.\\nThe midterm will be in the evening of Wednesday, October 23\\nfrom 7:15 to 9:15 pm in room 1240, Computer Sciences and Statistics.\\nThe final, as scheduled in the timetable, will be Tuesday, December 17\\nat 5:05 p.m.\\nThe first programming project (getting started) will count for 2% of your\\ngrade.\\nThe remaining four projects will count for 12% each.\\n\\n  Course Schedule  \\n\\nThe following schedule is tentative;\\nit may be updated later in the semester, so check back here frequently.\\n\\n\\nSept 3 - 6\\n    Introduction\\n    Chapter 1\\nSept 10 - Oct 8\\n    Processes, Synchronization, Processor Scheduling\\n    Chapters 2 and 6\\nSept 17\\n     Project 1  Due\\n    Learning Java\\nOct 10\\n     Project 2  Due\\n    Synchronization\\nOct 10 - Nov 11\\n    Memory Management and Virtual Memory\\n    Chapter 3\\nOct 22\\n     Project 3  Due\\n    CPU Scheduling\\nOct 23\\n    Midterm Exam\\nRoom 1240 Comp Sci.\\nNov 14 - Dec 5\\n    I/O Devices, File Systems\\n    Chapters 4 and 5\\nNov 14\\n    Project 4  Due\\n    Disk Scheduling\\nDec 10 - 12\\n    Protection and Security\\n    Sections 4.4 and 4.5\\nDec 12\\n    Project 5 Due\\n    File Systems\\nDec 17\\n    Final Exam\\n\\n  Lecture Notes  \\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\n     History\\n         What is an OS For?\\n     Bottom-up View\\n     Top-Down View\\n     Course Outline\\n\\n Java for C++ Programmers\\n Processes and Synchronization\\n\\n Using Processes \\n What is a Process? \\n Why Use Processes \\n Creating Processes \\n Process States \\n Synchronization \\n\\n Race Conditions \\n Semaphores \\n The Bounded Buffer Problem \\nThe Dining Philosophers \\nMonitors \\n Messages \\n\\n Deadlock\\n\\n Terminology \\n Deadlock Detection \\n Deadlock Recovery \\n Deadlock Prevention \\n Deadlock Avoidance \\n\\n Implementing Processes\\n\\n Implementing Monitors \\n Implementing Semaphores \\n Implementing Critical Sections \\n Short-term Scheduling \\n\\n\\nMemory Management \\n\\n Allocating Main Memory \\n\\n Algorithms for Memory Management \\n Compaction and Garbage Collection \\n Swapping \\n\\n\\nPaging \\nDisks \\n More to come ...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsolomon@cs.wisc.edu\\n\\n\\nThu Oct 31 16:24:20 CST 1996\\n\\n\\n\\nCopyright © 1996 by Marvin Solomon.

(The same statement\\nis not true about Pascal.  C is also widely available, but after an\\ninitial startup period you will be more productive in C++ than in C.)\\nIf you go on to take more computer science courses, with few exceptions\\nyou will be required to use C++ in those courses.\\n\\n\\nText\\n\\nThe text book for this course is\\n\\nData Abstraction and Problem Solving with C++: Walls and Mirrors \\n\\nby Frank M. Carrano (ISBN # 0-8053-1226-9).\\nThis is a well-written text that covers most\\n(but not all) of the material in this course.\\nIt also includes a lot about C++, so a separate text for the language is not\\nnecessary.\\nFor my lectures I will often (but not always) be following\\n \\nCS 367 Lecture Notes - Fall 1993\\n\\nby David J. DeWitt.\\nThese notes are actually considerably more complete that simple lecture\\nnotes, but they are still short of a true text book (there is\\nvery little narrative text, no exercises, etc.)\\nAs a recommended additional source, you may want to purchase these notes, which\\nare available from the DoIT documentation desk near the Dayton Street entrance\\nof the Computer Sciences building (1210 W. Dayton St).\\n\\nIf this is the first experience with Unix for you, you will need\\nsome information about activating your account, logging in, creating, editing,\\nand manipulating files, and compiling, running, and debugging programs.\\nThe handout\\nCS 1000, available from the DoIT information desk (where the DeWitt notes\\nare available), contains all the key information.\\nYou will find it invaluable.\\nSee also the  help section below.\\n\\nAs I mentioned above, the lectures will often follow the DeWitt notes, although\\nI may supplement them with a few handouts during the course\\nof the semester.\\nNonetheless,\\n\\nYou are responsible for all material covered in lecture!\\n\\nThe exams will be based on\\nthe lecture material, reading assignments in the notes, and\\nthe course assignments.\\n\\nGrading\\n\\nThere will be one or two evening exams during the course of the semester,\\na final exam and five programming assignments.\\nThe exams will determine 50% of the final grade\\n(with approximately equal weight for each one), and the programming\\nassignments will count for 10% each.\\n\\n\\n Exams \\n\\n\\n Exam 1\\n Tuesday, October 22nd, 7:15pm-9:15pm, 1351 Chemistry.\\n Exam 2\\n TBA\\n Final Exam \\n Wednesday, December 18th, 5:05pm-7:05pm, place TBA\\n\\n\\n Course Schedule \\n\\nThe following is the list of topics that will be covered in this\\ncourse.

These\\nare in the machine rooms on the first floor of the\\nCS building.  I encourage you to use these machines.\\n\\nIf you prefer to use a home computer, you may do so, with certain\\nrestrictions: You must have a C++ compiler on your home machine; \\nyou must log on to your university account often to read email\\nand get copies of data files; finally, we will require that\\nyou turn in your C++ program electronically (via email) so if you\\nwork at home you must make provisions to download your programs to\\nyour university account and to make sure that they compile and run\\nwith the g++ compiler on the SPARCstations.\\n\\nI often use electronic mail to notify students of changes in\\nassignments, hints for programs, etc.\\n\\nI assume that you will read all\\nelectronic mail that I send.\\n\\n\\nLate Policy\\n\\nNo late assignment will be accepted.\\nAssignments must be turned in exactly when they are due.\\nIn order to avoid lateness caused by machine loads, coincident due\\ndates for several classes, etc., simply be sure to get started right away on\\neach assignment.\\nThings are certain to go wrong now and then, so don't wait until the\\nlast minute to start.\\nAny exceptions must be approved by me, and you will need a very good excuse.\\nIf you get into trouble, see me as soon as possible.\\n\\n\\nCheating\\n\\nThe Computer Science department takes a very hard line\\nstance on cheating.\\nYou are welcome to\\ncommunicate with each other on design of algorithms and data\\nstructures, but\\n\\nthere is to be no sharing of code.\\n\\n\\nYou are also expected to learn, understand, and obey the\\nComputer Systems Lab Policies\\ngoverning your computer accounts.\\n\\nHelp\\n\\nIf you are having problems with the course work or programs,\\nplease let me know as early in the semester as possible.  \\nOffice Hours Policies\\nIf you need help debugging a program, the best way to get help is to\\nvisit any one of the\\nCS 367 TA's \\nduring his office hours, taking along a current\\nhard copy of your program.\\nMy office hours are intended as a time for me to re-explain concepts\\nthat I have presented in class but about which you are still confused,\\nor to answer your specific questions about course material.\\nI encourage you to use email as\\na reliable way to contact me about any problems;  I read and respond to email\\nseveral times daily, almost every day of the week.\\n\\n\\nProgram Grading\\n\\nPrograms are graded on all of the following criteria.\\n\\n\\nCorrectness: The program should behave correctly/normally on typical\\ninput.  The program should behave as stated in the project\\nspecifications.\\n\\nClarity:  The program should be easy to read and understand.\\n(See the notes on  style  below for more information\\nabout clarity).\\n\\nRobustness:  Correct behavior in extreme or unusual situations.\\nThe program should handle such situations in a reasonable and\\nlogical manner (that is, it should not simply blow up).\\n\\nQuality of test data:  The test data for the program should\\ndemonstrate all facets of the program's capabilities, including\\nunusual cases.  \\n\\nEfficiency:  Avoid unnecessarily inefficient algorithms or constructs.\\nHowever, efficiency should never be pursued at the expense of clarity.\\n\\nModularity:  The program should be modular and should make effective use\\nof parameters.\\n\\nCompleteness:  You should incorporate all information into your \\nprogram;  there should be no need for any sort of extra (paper)\\ndocumentation.\\n\\nGenerality:\\nThe program should be as general as possible, subject to consideration\\nof efficiency and clarity.\\nYou should avoid arbitrary limitations (such as a bound on the size or\\ncomplexity of the input) whenever possible.\\nWhen limitations are necessary, they should be expressed as defined\\nconstants near the top of the program so that they can be easily changed.\\nThe only numeric literals that should appear in your program are those\\nvalues not very likely to change (such as 0, 1, or 3.1415926535).\\n\\n\\nStyle\\n\\n\\n\\nUse meaningful identifier names.\\n\\nUse a consistent naming scheme for identifier names.\\nA suggested convention is as follows\\n\\n\\n int variable_name; \\n\\n int function_name(int argument); \\n\\n const int DEFINED_CONSTANT = 1234; \\n\\n enum EnumType { VALUE1, VALUE2 }; \\n\\n class ClassName ... \\n\\n\\nDo not put multiple statements on a single line.\\n\\nSkip lines between functional groups of code.\\n\\nUse a clear and consistent indentation style (see the DeWitt notes\\nfor a suggested style).\\n\\n\\nIndent continued statements (if, loops, ... etc).\\n\\nLine up {'s and }'s.\\n\\nLabel }'s meaningfully (e.g.  ``} // while (!done)'').\\n\\n\\n\\nExternal Documentation\\n\\nThis should be included as a long comment at the beginning of your\\nprogram.  It is addressed to both the typical user and to someone\\nwho wants to know superficially how the program works:\\n\\n\\n\\nInclude your full name and student ID at the beginning of the comment.\\n\\n\\nGive a general description of what the program does.\\n\\nTell how to use the program: how to call it, format of data.\\n\\nGive limitations, bugs, special features, and assumptions made.\\nDescribe negative as well as positive aspects of the program.\\nIf you don't include negatives we will assume you were unaware of them. \\n\\nInformation included in the assignment about the problem description\\nneed not be repeated, but may be briefly summarized for the first point above.\\nA statement referring the user to the assignment document is then\\nsufficient. Note that this only applies to the problem description!\\n\\nInternal Documentation\\n\\nThere are four main types of internal documentation:\\n\\n\\nHeaders:\\nComments at the headers of functions, classes, and major data structures\\nshould describe their purpose, assumptions about their parameters,\\nand the main outline of any algorithms they use.\\n\\nDeclarations:  Comments next to a declaration of a variable or data member\\nshould provide extra information not conveyed by the identifier's\\nname.\\nThe name of a variable should tell as much about it as is possible without\\nmaking it too long;\\nadditional information can be supplied by a comment.  For example\\n\\n   int top; // index of last element added to stack\\n\\nYou should use comments to explain parameters as well as local variables. \\n\\nWithin segments of code:  Tricky or opaque sections of code should be\\navoided, but sometimes they are necessary.  In such cases, a comment\\ncan help the reader understand what's going on.\\n\\nBetween segments of code:  These comments clarify the top-level outline\\nof your algorithm.\\n\\n\\n Using Unix and Vi\\n\\nMany people working with UNIX for the\\nfirst time will find that it takes some time to become\\ncomfortable with it (this is particularly true if your\\nonly previous programming experience is with Pascal using \\nMacPascal on a MacIntosh.)  I strongly urge you to put in\\nthe time early in the semester to become comfortable with\\nUnix.  While this time may be painful, it is time well\\nspent.\\nAlso, you may wish to attend a UNIX tutorial.\\nThey will be held in rooms 1240 Comp Sci in two sessions on each of the\\nfollowing days: TBA\\nYou will want to pick up a copy of \\n CS 1000 before you go.\\n\\n\\n The Program Development Cycle \\n\\nThe program development cycle in a UNIX environment is:\\n\\n\\nfor (;;) {\\n    edit your program             // %vi program.c\\n    compile your program          // %g++ -Wall -g  program.c\\n    if (there are compilation errors)\\n        continue;\\n    run your program              // %a.out < inputfile > outputfile\\n    look at your output           // %vi outputfile\\n                                  // or %more outputfile\\n    if (there are no errors)\\n        break;\\n    if (you are too tired to continue) {\\n\\tprint a listing to take home\\n                 // pr program.c inputfile outputfile | lpr\\n\\tgoto home\\n    }\\n    debug the program\\n                                  // gdb a.out\\n                                  // run\\n                                  // ...\\n                                  // quit\\n}\\nyou're done!  turn in the result\\n\\t\\t // submission instruction to be given out later\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n yannis@cs.wisc.edu \\n\\nMon Aug 19 17:28:14 CDT 1996\\n\\n\\n\"}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cs.wisc.edu^~cs354-3^cs354', 'pagename': 'CS 354 - Home Page - Fall 1996', 'content': \"Date: Mon, 11 Nov 1996 18:08:52 GMT\\nServer: NCSA/1.5\\nContent-type: text/html\\nLast-modified: Mon, 11 Nov 1996 16:37:00 GMT\\nContent-length: 7755\\n\\n\\n\\n CS 354 - Home Page - Fall 1996 \\n\\n\\n\\n CS 354 - Fall 1996 \\n Course Information \\n\\n\\n Instructors and Office Hours\\n TAs and Office Hours\\n Class Cancellations\\n Handouts\\n Assignments\\n Solutions\\n Exams\\n Grades\\n Simulator Help\\n Lecture Notes\\n Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Instructors: \\n\\nSections 1 and 3: Jerry Tusch\\n\\n Office: 1309 CS&S  Phone: 262-6603\\n Hours: 10-11 & 4-5 MW, 9-10 F\\n e-mail: jerry@cs.wisc.edu  or  tutsch@execpc.com\\n\\n Class: section 1, MWF 11am-12:15 in 1325 CS\\n\\t section 3, MW 5-6:40pm in 168 Noland\\n\\n\\nSection 2: Karen Miller\\n\\n Office: 3387 CSS, Phone 263-1724\\n Hours: MW 10-11am\\n e-mail: smoler@cs.wisc.edu\\n\\n Class Time: MWF 8:25-9:40am in 107 Psychology\\n\\n\\n\\n TAs: \\nSunlung Suen\\n\\n\\n Office: 1347 CSS, Phone 262-5786\\n Hours: TuTh 2:30-3:30pm\\n e-mail: ssuen@cs.wisc.edu\\n\\nSridevi Bhamidipati\\n\\n\\n Office: 1351 CSS, Phone: 263-1938\\n Hours: WR 4:00-5:00pm\\n e-mail: bsri@cs.wisc.edu\\n\\nMohammad Asgarian\\n\\n\\n Office: 5364 CSS, Phone: 262-5105\\n Hours: TuTh 2:30-3:30pm\\n e-mail: ma@cs.wisc.edu\\n\\n\\n Class Cancellations: \\n\\nKaren's section:\\n\\n no class on Monday September 23.\\n no class on Wednesday November 27.\\n\\n\\nJerry's sections:\\n\\n no cancellations scheduled\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Handouts: \\n\\n\\n revised Chapter 9 (postscript)\\n Course Overview (Jerry's \\nsections, html)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAssignments\\n\\n\\n\\n Assignment #1 (hw.html,  pgm.html ) \\n Assignment #2 (program and homework)\\n Assignment #3, Karen's section (program and homework)\\n Assignment #4 (program and homework)\\n Assignment #5 (program and homework)\\n Assignment #6 (program and homework)\\n\\n\\n\\nSolutions\\n\\n\\n Quiz #1:  Sections  1 , \\n 2 ,\\n 3 \\n Assignment #1 (hw.html , \\n program ) \\n Quiz #2:  Sections  1 , \\n 2 , \\n 3 \\n Assignment #2 (hw.html , \\n program ) \\n Quiz #3:  Sections  1 , \\n 2 , \\n 3 \\n Assignment #3 (hw.html , \\n program ) \\n Quiz #4:  Sections  1 , \\n 2 , \\n 3 \\n Assignment #4 (hw.html , \\n programSAL ,\\n programMAL ) \\n Quiz #5:  Sections  1 , \\n 2 , \\n 3 \\n Assignment #5 (hw.html , \\n program ) \\n Quiz #6:  Sections  1 , \\n 2 , \\n 3 \\n Assignment #6 (hw.html , \\n programA ,\\n programB ) \\n Quiz #7:  Sections  1 , \\n 2 , \\n 3 \\n\\n\\n\\n Exams\\n\\nAll quizzes will be open book/note, NO calculators.\\n\\n\\n FOR KAREN'S SECTION:\\n\\n Quiz 1  Friday September 13, in class\\n Quiz 2  Friday September 27, in class\\n Quiz 3  Friday October 11, in class\\n Quiz 4  Friday October 25, in class\\n Quiz 5  Friday November 8, in class\\n Quiz 6  Friday November 22, in class\\n Quiz 7  probably Friday December 13 (last class day)\\n OPTIONAL final   Thursday December 19 at 12:25pm\\n\\nA very difficult, cumulative final will be offered for those desperate\\nto raise their grade.

Its purpose is threefold; first, to\\nencourage you to investigate the nature of computation; second, to further\\ndevelop your formal reasoning and writing skills; and third, to add new\\ntechniques to your programming bag of tricks. \\n\\nAccordingly, we will develop several formal models of computation, each\\nmore powerful than the last.  At each stage we will prove some of what our\\nintuition suggests (and sometimes, what it denies) about these models.  We\\nwill also see how most models admit two very different characterizations:\\none of machines that are able to recognize certain events, and another of\\ngrammars that are able to generate exactly what these machines recognize.  \\n\\nIn particular, we will study regular languages, regular expressions, finite\\ndeterministic and nondeterministic automata, context-free grammars,\\npushdown automata, turing machines --- and more, if time allows. \\nGrading\\n\\n6 Homeworks    60%\\nMidterm        20%     Thursday, October 19\\nFinal          20%     Saturday, December 16, 12:30-2:30pm\\n\\n\\nNote that each test is worth 2 homeworks.  The tests will be much simpler\\nthan the homeworks. \\nHomework Assignments\\n\\nWhen writing up your homework, there are two goals you must keep in mind:\\nfirst, to give evidence that you have put real thought into the problem,\\nand second, to convince the reader that your solution is correct and\\nthat you know why.  As a programmer, you have some experience with\\nthis sort of writing: an effective program must be written for both a\\ncompiler and a human reader.  Similarly, solutions to your problems must be\\ncorrect in the sense of solving the stated problem, but they must also be\\ncomprehensible to the grader. \\n\\nAs with any writing, the first draft of a problem solution is usually\\nunpresentable.  All of the pieces may be there, but they tend to be\\nchaotically assembled.  The single most important thing you can do\\nto make your solutions presentable is to rewrite them after you have\\ndiscovered why they are correct, and then to throw away (or at least tuck\\naway) your initial draft.  Remember, scratch paper is cheap. \\n\\nBe careful to realize that this emphasis on presentation has nothing to do\\nwith whether English is your native language or whether you prefer to write\\nyour solutions with pencil, pen, quill, or word processor. \\n  A well-written solution starts by stating assumptions and then\\nworks towards a clearly defined goal, emphasizing the overall direction and\\nomitting the superfluous. \\nLate Policy\\n\\nIn general, you will have at least one week to work on a homework\\nassignment and at least three opportunities to attend my office hours\\nbefore that assignment is due.  \\n\\n\\nAssignments turned in late for any reason will be marked late and will be\\nscored at 60% of their face value.  Assignments turned in more than a week\\nafter they were due will be scored at 0% of their face value --- that is, we\\nwill still attempt to evaluate them, but they will not count towards your\\ngrade.  For \"excused\" lateness, such as illness and family emergency, see\\nthe \"Grading Appeals\" section below. \\nCollaboration and Plagiarism\\n\\ncol.lab.o.rate \\\\k*-\\'lab-*-.ra-t\\\\ \\\\-.lab-*-\\'ra--sh*n\\\\ \\\\-\\'lab-*-.ra-t-iv\\\\ \\n   \\\\-.ra-t-*r\\\\ vi [LL collaboratus, pp. of collaborare to labor together, fr. \\n   L com- + laborare to labor] 1: to work jointly with others esp. in an \\n   intellectual endeavor 2: to cooperate with or assist usu. willingly an \\n   enemy of one\\'s country and esp. an occupying force 3: to cooperate with an \\n   agency or instrumentality with which one is not immediately connected - \\n   col.lab.o.ra.tion n\\n\\n\\nCollaboration is encouraged (primarily in the first and third senses) when\\nworking on homework problems and preparing for exams.  None of the problems\\nin this class are intended to have secret solutions; the more resourceful\\nyou are at discovering solutions, the more time you will have to write them\\nwell.  Indeed, if you are stuck on a problem, I will be happy to talk with\\nyou about it during office hours.  However, the solutions you turn in must\\nbe your original writing.  Copying a prepared solution is not collaboration\\nat all; it is plagiarism. \\n\\npla.gia.rize \\\\\\'pla--j*-.ri-z also -je--*-\\\\ vt : to steal and pass off as \\n   one\\'s own (the ideas or words of another) to present as one\\'s own an idea \\n   or product derived from an existing source - pla.gia.riz.er n\\n\\n\\nPlagiarizing another\\'s words is not tolerated at Boston University.  It is\\nso disdained that there are specific procedures for accusing and punishing\\nthose who plagiarize.  Do not copy another person\\'s work and present it as\\nyour own. \\n\\n(The above definitions were snatched from the Webster server at BU.) \\nGrading Appeals\\nSimple clerical errors will be corrected as soon as they\\nare brought to my attention. \\n\\n\\nPerhaps you will disagree about the grading of a particular problem\\nor feel that an instance of lateness was justified.  In order to bring this\\nto my attention, you must prepare a written appeal with supporting\\ndocuments and give it to me during the last week of class.  I will\\ncarefully consider these appeals and make reasonable adjustments to your\\nbenefit when preparing the final grades.  \\n\\nThis is only a mechanism for dealing with my gradebook in a fair\\nmanner.  You are always welcome to approach me with your\\nconcerns. \\n\\nIf you don\\'t know whether or how to write an appeal,\\nuse this as a guideline: I am likely to look more kindly upon \"That was\\njust a really bad week for me\" than \"My homework was always late because\\nI... uh... had a headache.\" \\nAttendance\\n\\nAttendance is not an official part of the course grade, but it is your\\nresponsibility to stay informed.  Some announcements will be made only in\\nclass. \\nMailing List\\n\\nOther announcements will be made only by email.

In particular we will adopt as our\\ncase study the software system associated with a World Wide Web server.\\nThe course will consist of code walk-throughs and lectures.  Code\\nwalk-throughs will include: at the kernel level\\n(namely in Linux),\\nthe network, file system,\\nand process scheduling functions; and at the application level,\\none Web server (Apache).\\nLectures will cover research issues in server design,\\nperformance modeling, and simulation techniques.  This seminar will\\nbe a prerequisite or corequisite for participating in the Commonwealth\\nServer Project, which is being led by the instructors; however any\\nstudent who is interested in studying the implementation of a\\nnetworked computer system is invited to attend.  We will be asking\\nattendees to be notetakers for a week.  As a notetaker,\\nyour job is to keep track of the main themes of the \\ndiscussion and any interesting\\npoints made by any of the participants.\\n\\n\\n\\nParticipation in this seminar is by encouragement/consent\\nof one of the instructors.\\nStudents taking this course for credit will be expected to complete a\\nrelated project chosen in consultation with one of the instructors.  The\\nproject cannot serve also as a Master's project, however, if a two-phase\\nproposal is accepted by the instructor the second phase can serve as a MS\\nproject.  Students may form teams to work on projects, however, the project\\nscope must scale linearly with the team size, and work must be explicitly\\nload balanced in a fair way.  It's also OK to take this course for no\\ncredit, but to use it to lead on to an MS project during a subsequent\\nsemester.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe will schedule a brownbag (or two) at the end of the semester.\\nEach\\nstudent participating will be asked to talk for a short\\ntime (10 mins) on their project or on a related topic.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally,\\nfor more information on the Commonwealth Server Project, follow\\n\\nthis link.\\n\\nCourse Schedule\\n\\nHere's the proposed week-by-week schedule of topics we'd like to cover.\\nDuring weeks 5 through 9 our code walkthroughs will take us through version\\n2.0.10 of the Linux kernel\\n(see \\nlinux-2.0.10/ under\\n/sw/course/cs835-f96/).\\nDuring weeks 10 and 11 our code walkthroughs will be through\\nversion 1.1.1 of the Apache server\\n(see\\napache_1.1.1/ in the same place).\\nIf you're a presenter or a scribe for a particular week,\\nplease mail your notes\\nto djy@cs.bu.edu so that they can be linked to this home\\npage.\\n\\n\\n  Week 1  (9/9) - Research Problems in Networks and Computer Systems\\n\\nPresenter: Mark Crovella\\nNotes; Scribe: Mark Crovella\\n  Week 2  (9/16) - Review of Related Work in Networks and Computer\\n                   Systems\\nPresenters: A.

If you haven't done so but still want to remain in the course,\\nplease see me. \\n\\nMA 293 (Discrete Mathematics 1). \\nCS 112 or CS 113 (Programming & Data Structures in C). \\n\\nTopics\\nThis course is a core requirement in undergraduate computer science curriculums\\nat most colleges. Its purpose is threefold; first, to encourage you to investigate\\nthe nature of computation; second, to further develop your formal reasoning\\nand writing skills; and third, to add new techniques to your programming\\nbag of tricks. \\nAccordingly, we will develop several formal models of computation, each\\nmore powerful than the last. At each stage we will prove some of what our\\nintuition suggests (and sometimes, what it denies) about these models. We\\nwill also see how most models admit two very different characterizations:\\none of machines that are able to recognize certain events, and another of\\ngrammars that are able to generate exactly what these machines recognize. \\nIn particular, we will study regular languages, regular expressions, finite\\ndeterministic and nondeterministic automata, context-free grammars, pushdown\\nautomata, turing machines --- and more, if time allows. \\n\\nGrading\\nThe following breakdown is tentative but reasonably representative of how\\ngrades will be computed. I mentioned an optional project, but I haven't\\ndecided how to fit that into the scheme yet.\\n\\n6 Homeworks    60%\\nMidterm        20%     Thursday, 10/24, 12:30-1:50pm\\nFinal          20%     Tuesday, 12/17, 12:30-2:30 pm\\n\\nNote that each test is worth 2 homeworks. The tests will be much simpler\\nthan the homeworks. \\nHomework Assignments\\nWhen writing up your homework, there are two goals you must keep in mind:\\nfirst, to give evidence that you have put real thought into the problem,\\nand second, to convince the reader that your solution is correct and that you know why. As a programmer, you have some experience with this sort of writing: an\\neffective program must be written for both a compiler and a human reader.\\nSimilarly, solutions to your problems must be correct in the sense of solving\\nthe stated problem, but they must also be comprehensible to the grader. \\nAs with any writing, the first draft of a problem solution is usually unpresentable.\\nAll of the pieces may be there, but they tend to be chaotically assembled. The single most important thing you can do to make your solutions presentable is to rewrite them after you have discovered\\nwhy they are correct, and then to throw away (or at least tuck away) your\\ninitial draft. Remember, scratch paper is cheap. \\nBe careful to realize that this emphasis on presentation has nothing to\\ndo with whether English is your native language or whether you prefer to\\nwrite your solutions with pencil, pen, quill, or word processor. A well-written\\nsolution starts by stating assumptions and then works towards a clearly\\ndefined goal, emphasizing the overall direction and omitting the superfluous. \\n\\nLate Policy\\nIn general, you will have at least one week to work on a homework assignment\\nand three opportunities to attend my office hours before that assignment\\nis due. \\nAssignments turned in during one of the two class periods following the\\ndue date will be graded at 60% of their face value. Assignments turned in\\nlater than that will receive no credit, but we'll still grade them for feedback\\npurposes.\\nCollaboration and Plagiarism\\n\\ncol.lab.o.rate \\\\k*-'lab-*-.ra-t\\\\ \\\\-.lab-*-'ra--sh*n\\\\ \\\\-'lab-*-.ra-t-iv\\\\ \\n   \\\\-.ra-t-*r\\\\ vi [LL collaboratus, pp. of collaborare to labor together, fr. \\n   L com- + laborare to labor] 1: to work jointly with others esp. in an \\n   intellectual endeavor 2: to cooperate with or assist usu. willingly an \\n   enemy of one's country and esp. an occupying force 3: to cooperate with an \\n   agency or instrumentality with which one is not immediately connected - \\n   col.lab.o.ra.tion n\\n\\nCollaboration is encouraged (primarily in the first and third senses) when\\nworking on homework problems and preparing for exams. None of the problems\\nin this class are intended to have secret solutions; the more resourceful\\nyou are at discovering solutions, the more time you will have to write them\\nwell. Indeed, if you are stuck on a problem, I will be happy to talk with\\nyou about it during office hours. However, the solutions you turn in must\\nbe your original writing.

You will be\\nexpected to read the assigned literature beforeand optionally after the\\nscheduled lecture.\\n \\nPrerequisites  Senior or Graduate standing, \\ncomputer architecture,\\nCalculus, Creativity.\\n \\nLab (3346 TMCB): 4 Mac II's with 5MB RAM and \\n40 MB hard drives.  2\\nDS5000 workstations with 32MB RAM and 1GB disks and 3 high speed HP\\nworkstations. (These may be used when available but the researching\\ngraduate students have priority on these machines).  Software for\\nsimulations, projects, etc. will be made available.\\n \\nLiterature: I have placed interesting and \\nrepresentative papers for\\nreference in the periodicals room of the HBLL library.  There are two\\nseparate packets (2 copies of the first) and both are under my name.  As\\nneeded, I will place more packets in the library.  I also have more papers\\nin my office which can be looked over and copied under constraint of the 15\\nminute rule.  I can also send for most any paper you wish through\\ninterlibrary loan, (and will do so), but it usually takes 2-3 weeks, so\\nplan ahead.\\n \\nGrading (~):  Simulations and Homeworks: 30%, Midterm: 22.5%, Project:\\n22.5%, Final: 25% (Tue., Dec. 14,  7am-10am). Grading is on a curve and\\nsome amount of subjectivity is allowed for attendance, participation,\\nperceived effort, etc.  If you think, you'll be all right \\n \\nLate assignments:    Assignments are expected on \\ntime (beginning of\\nclass on due date).  Late papers will be  marked off at 5%/school day late.\\n However, if you have any unusual circumstances (sick, out of town, unique\\nfrom what all the other students have, etc.), which you inform me of, then\\nI will not take off any late points.  Nothing will be accepted after the\\nlast day of class instruction.\\n \\nProject:   An indepth effort on a particular aspect of neural\\nnetworks.  A relatively extensive literature search in the area is expected\\nwith a subsequent bibliography.  Good projects are typically as follows: \\nBest:  Some of your own original thinking and proposal of a network,\\nlearning paradigm, system, etc.  This (and other projects) are typically\\nwell benefited by some computer simulation to bear out potential.  Very\\nGood:  Starting from an indepth study of some current model, strive to\\nextend it through some new mechanisms.  Not Bad: A study of a current model\\nwith an indepth analysis of its strengths, weaknesses, potential, and\\nsuggested research.  Not Good:  A description of a current model.  The\\nearlier you start the better.  Note that in a semester course like this,\\nyou will have to choose a topic when we have only covered half of the\\nmaterial.  That does not mean your project must cover items related to the\\nfirst half of the semester.  You should use your own initiative and the\\nresources available (library literature, texts, me, etc.) to peruse and\\nfind any topic of interest to you, regardless of whether we have or will\\ncover it in class.  Interesting models which we will probably not have time\\nto cover indepth in class include: Feldman nets, Genetic algorithms,\\nKohonen maps, HOTLU's, BAMs, CMAC, ASN, Cognitron, Neo-Cognitron, BolzCONS,\\nMichie Boxes, Cauchy Machines, Counterpropagation, Madaline II, Associative\\nNetworks, RCE, etc, etc.\\n \\n\\n Topics and Reading Assignments\\n 1.

Information on getting started with each of these is online.\\n\\n\\n\\nAssignments\\n\\n\\n Assignment 1: Lazy Functional Languages Haskell (Gofer) is a\\nstrongly typed functional language with lazy evaluation.  in this\\nassignment you will explore Haskell and see how it relates to other\\nlanguages with which you are familiar. The resource document is the Haskell tutorial (in\\nPostScript).  Read it, run the examples, and write some code. Think about\\nhow it compares with other languages you know such as Pascal, C++, Scheme,\\nLisp, Prolog.  How is it the same? How is it different?  What's good about\\nit?  What's not good about it? Why does functional programming matter?\\n\\nObviously, you will not be able to cover every aspect of the language.\\nPick some part of Haskell that appeals to you or you think is interesting\\nand explore that in depth.\\n\\nMore information\\non the Haskell Programming language  is available here.   A manual (in HTML) is\\navailable online.\\nPaper: Week of September 9th.\\n\\n Assignment 2: Programming with Lists\\nUsing Chapter 3 of Reade and Chapter 3 in Davie as references, explore the\\nuse of lists in Haskell.  Pay special attention to list comprehensions, how\\ncomprehensions can be translated to simpler functions, and to the use of\\nstructural induction in proving properties of functional programs that use\\nlists.  \\nPaper: Week of September 16th.  This paper may be an\\nextension of what you did last week or a new topic.  \\n\\n Assignment 3: Datatypes and Interpreters\\nUse Chapters 5 and 6 of Reade as your primary references with supporting\\nchapters from Davie.  There are a number of simple command interpreters in\\nthe literature.  In fact, its so easy to define simple interpreters using\\nconcrete datatypes to represent abstract syntax and pattern-matching\\nfunctions as the interpreter that the literature is full of examples of\\nsmall interpreters defined in functional languages.\\n\\nPaper: Week of September Sep 30th.  I'd like you to explore\\nthe use of functional languages to define the operational semantics of\\nlanguages.  There are some interesting extensions to what you'll find in\\nReade.  For example, can you define an interpreter for a small assembly\\nlanguage and then define a translator from Reade's language into your\\nassembly language?  Does interpreting a chunk of code using the\\ninterpret function give the result as translating it and then\\nrunning it on your assembly language interpreter?  This is just one\\nidea. There are a lot of place to go with this.\\n\\n\\nNote that you have two weeks to work on this.  Your groups will not meet\\nwith me the week of the 23rd since I'll be out of town Thursday and Friday.\\nContinue to meet with groups.  Ask me any questions you have.  Since you\\nhave two weeks to work on this, I'll expect the papers to be higher quality\\nand the work to be more  complete.  \\n\\n Assignment 4: Lazy Evaluation\\nI'd like you to explore\\nlazy evaluation using Chapter 7 of Reade and whatever other resources you\\ncan get your hands on.  Brownie points for outside references.\\n\\nPaper: Week of Oct 7th.  (continued to week of Oct 14th)\\n\\n Assignment 5: Denotational Semantics\\n\\nRead and explore chapter 10 of Reade.  There are a lot of resources on\\ndenotational semantics, make use of them.  Don't get into fixpoint\\nsemantics too heavily since we'll do that next week.\\n\\nPaper: During the week of Oct 21st, I'd like a preliminary\\npaper that we can discuss.  You'll be expanding it over the coming few\\nweeks.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Go to the BYU CS Department Home Page \\nCreated Jan 6, 1995\\nUpdated\\nTue Sep 10 10:02:46 1996\\n\\nby Phillip J.

Since \\nCS 431 is a prerequisite to this\\ncourse, a basic knowledge and understanding of compilers is assumed.  This\\ncourse will take a more in-depth look at compiler topics such as various\\nparsing techniques and grammars, code optimization, error recovery, and\\ntype checking.\\n\\n\\nGrading\\nFinal grades will be determined from the following:\\n\\t\\n\\tMidterm Exam:\\t30%\\n\\tFinal Exam:\\t35%\\n\\tPrograms:\\t30%\\n\\tPapers:\\t\\t 5%\\n\\nPrograms\\nAll programs for this course will be written in either C or C++.\\n You can use any machine you would like.  Access to the department PCs or\\nUNIX machines will be given for those who need and desire it.  There will\\nbe three programs assigned throughout the semester.  They will be fairly\\ntime consuming and involved, so it is strongly recommended that you begin\\nearly on them.  You will pass off your assignments by running them on input\\nthat I give you and turning in the results.  If you begin early on the\\nassignments and budget your time wisely, you will have enough time to\\ncomplete the assignments.  If you don't, you probably won't finish.  \\n\\n\\nSince\\nlate homework is such a hassle to deal with, you will be penalized\\nsubstantially for turning you work in late.  \\nThe late policy is:  a\\n10% deduction the first day late, 20% the second day, 30% the third day,\\n40% for the fourth day, 50% for the fifth day, and no credit will be given\\nafter that time.\\n\\nThe first program will be to write a\\nlexical analyzer generator.  For\\nthose of you familiar with LEX, you will essentially be writing a LEX\\nequivalent.  The second assignment will be\\nto write a parser generator \\n(like YACC).  The third assignment will\\ndeal with compiler optimizations.\\n\\nPapers\\nYou will write two papers this semester.  The first will be due\\nFeb. 9, and the second will be due March 30.  The papers will be between 3\\nand 6 pages in length and must contain at least 3 bibliographic references.\\n\\n For each paper you are to take a research topic in compiler construction,\\ndescribe the topic, reference work that has been done in the area, and\\npresent ways of improving previous work or new ideas for solving the\\nproblem at hand.  The purpose of the papers is to familiarize you with\\ncurrent work being done in this field.  The best way of accomplishing this\\nis to have you research into the current literature and become familiar\\nwith journals, conferences and people in this area.\\n\\nCourse Notes\\nThe course notes are available in the reserve section of the library.\\n\\nExams\\nThere will be one mid-term exam during the semester on March 2.\\nThe final will be held Wednesday, April 26 from 3 PM to 6 PM.\\n\\nTentative Course Outline\\nThere is a tentative course outline available.\\n\\n CS.531 News Group \\n\\nThere is a  news group  for this class \\nwhere students can have discussions.\\n\\n\\n\\nGo to\\nBYU CS Courses\\n\\n\\n\\nConverted to HTML Wed Jan 18 11:38:29 1995 ... \\nUpdated\\nWed Jan 18 12:05:45 1995\\n\\nby Paul E.

To access these computers you will\\nneed CS department student account. If you are a CS major, you can get an\\naccount by going here. If you are\\nnot a CS major, you will need to visit the systems programmers in room 2254\\nTMCB. \\nCourse Philosophy\\nThe goal of this course is not so much the content as learning how to learn\\nnew systems in graphical user interfaces. Because of this we will only spend\\na limited amount of time on Visual C++. Students will be taught general\\nconcepts and then introduced to the way in which MS Windows implements those\\nconcepts. It will be up to the student (with some help from the TA) to find\\nout the details necessary to complete the programming assignments.\\n\\nBecause of this goal of teaching how to learn, there will not be as much\\nlecture as in most CS classes. For each class period there will be reading\\nassignments and problems which must be completed before class. Most of the\\nclass period will consist of presentation and discussion from students chosen\\nrandomly from the class. This participation will be graded, as discussed\\nbelow. \\nGrading\\n\\nExams 40% \\n  \\n2 Tests 10% each \\n  Final exam 20% (half of this exam will cover the last third of the\\ncourse and half will be comprehensive) \\n  \\nPrograms 40% (there will be 5 large programs, each reuses pieces from\\nprevious programs) \\nClass Participation 20% \\n  \\nStudents will be regularly asked to present or discuss reading materials\\nin class.

Core material will be presented with greater emphasis.  You will be responsible for the contents of the entire text except as stated in class.  Always read each chapter before it is presented in class.\\n\\nTIME ALLOTMENT\\n\\nThis course is an elective senior/graduate course which follows the guideline of two to three hours out of class for every hour in class, for an average total of nine to twelve hours per week.\\n\\nGRADING\\n\\nYour final grade is determined strictly from the percentage of points earned out of points possible.  The approximate breakdown is as follows:\\n\\n  Midterms             \\t\\t30% \\n  Final Examination    \\t20%\\n  Graphics Package     \\t50% \\n\\n       TOTAL          \\t\\t100%\\n\\n  Letter grades are assigned as follows:\\n\\nA     93.3% and above \\tB-  above 80.0%     \\tD+  above 56.7%\\nA-    above 90.0%     \\tC+  above 73.3%    \\tD   above 53.3%\\nB+    above 86.7%     \\tC   above 66.7%     \\tD-  above 50.0%\\nB     above 83.3%     \\tC-  above 60.0%     \\tE   above 00.0%\\n\\nI     Circumstances beyond the student`s control and not in his contemplation\\n      occurring after the 12th week of the semester\\n\\nUW    No activity after the 12th week of the semester.\\nMIDTERMS AND FINAL EXAMINATION\\n\\nMidterms will be multiple choice, closed book, closed notes, and administered in the Testing Center.  \\n\\nThe Final Examination will consist of two parts: 1) questions taken from the midterms, possibly with the wording or information changed, but testing the same concepts,  2) material since the last midterm.  Instead of taking any or all of part (1), you may elect to carry his midterm percentage(s) forward to this part.  The Final Examination will be timed, multiple choice, closed book, closed notes on Wednesday, December 18, 1996 in the Testing Center.\\n\\nPROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT DEADLINES, LATE DAYS, AND EARLY DAYS \\n\\nThere are four phases or programming assignments, as follows:\\n\\n           Title                         Points     \\t\\tDue Date\\nPhase 1: Primitives             85 points \\tOctober 2, 1996\\nPhase 2: 2D Graphics\\t   85 points \\tOctober 23, 1996\\nPhase 3: 3D Graphics\\t   85 points \\tNovember 22, 1996\\n  Phase 4: Three Options   85 points \\tDecember 13, 1996\\n\\n Ray Tracing or\\n Fractals or\\n Animation\\n\\n (choose 1 option only)\\n  Total Points:                      340 points\\n\\nYou may earn up to 100 points in any phase.\\n       \\nYou may accumulate up to five late days without penalty.  Late days consist of Monday through Friday except holidays.  Once five late days have been accumulated, each additional day results in a 10% (of maximum points) loss.  No work will be accepted after December 13, 1996.\\n\\nWork submitted early accumulates early days against which subsequent late days may be charged without penalty.\\n\\nGRAPHICS PACKAGE REQUIREMENTS\\nGENERAL OVERVIEW\\n\\nThe objective of these requirements is to allow you to design and implement a basic but useful three-dimensional graphics package.  Emphasis is given to fundamental computer graphics elements that are common to all general purpose 3D computer graphics packages.  This course does not emphasize documentation or software design nor does it emphasize user interfaces.  These are appropriate subjects for other courses and are of obvious importance.  The goal of this course is to allow you to gain an understanding of the important fundamental algorithms and techniques used in computer graphics.\\n\\nNow, a warning to the wise concerning some things you should do so that you have a pleasant experience in this course.  First, scan ahead and read all parts of the text that have something to do with your implementation.  This saves you from realizing down the road that the architecture of your package cannot easily accommodate a new capability that must be incorporated.  Understand all the elements and how they will fit together from the start.  Design your package ahead of time.  This task, though time consuming, saves you a lot of headaches later on.  There simply is not enough time in the semester to finish your package if you wait until a concept is discussed in class before you begin to think about it or to implement it.  While this philosophy may be odd to some, this is the only way you can produce a good package in this class given the unavoidable time constraints common to university courses and to actual production environments.\\n\\nSecond, start early!  The pass-off deadlines come up very fast.  Try always to keep a couple of weeks ahead so that you aren\\'t caught short and so that you have time left at the end of the semester to meet your other responsibilities.\\n\\nThird, make your code robust.  Use good sense and your knowledge of good program design.  \\n\\nFinally, do not limit yourself to the course textbook.  Read other texts and any other material that may give more information on a subject or explain it better.  Other sources can be of great value to you for your implementation.\\n\\nMACHINES AND LANGUAGES\\n\\nStudents may use any machines or languages that are capable of accommodating the package requirements and to which they have authorized access for CS 455. To make pass-offs manageable for the TA, you must pass-off your package on a computer located on BYU\\'s campus which you have authorized access to.  If you develop your package on a computer at home, please make sure that there is a compatible computer which will run your package on campus.  Otherwise, you will be under the necessity of transporting your computer to campus for each pass-off, which might not be convenient for you unless the computer is a laptop.  The display device should be capable of displaying at least 256 different colors at a resolution of at least 640 x 480 pixels.\\n\\nSeveral department machines are available:\\n\\n  SGI\\'s :             \\t2244 TMCB (machines of choice).\\n   Info.\\n  PC\\'s :              \\t1149 TMCB \\n  MAC\\'s :            \\t1149 TMCB (CS 143 and CS 535 have priority)\\n  UNIX systems :  \\t2204 and 2240 TMCB\\nINTERFACE AND PASS-OFF PROCEDURE\\n \\nA static demo is NOT sufficient for pass-off.  Your implementation must be somewhat interactive.  The objective of the pass-off is to demonstrate the robustness of your implementation by performing arbitrary graphics functions. There are several options you may choose from depending on your preferences and development environment.  \\n\\n  1) GUI    \\t\\t\\tYou may use mouse, keyboard, menus, dialogs, or any controls  you wish.  However, this is not required.  It is assumed that this interface will be intuitive.  The supported commands and their optional parameters will be tested using the GUI.\\n\\n  2) Script-File\\t\\tYou may create and process a simple script file to demonstrate the functionality of your software.  Please provide the syntax or sample commands that can be processed from the script file.   The supported commands and their optional parameters will be tested by editing the script files and then processing them.  \\n\\n  3) Command-Line   \\tYou may use a command line interface.  If you choose this option please include the ability to print out the commands and parameters on a simple help screen.  The supported commands and their optional parameters will be tested using the command-line interface.  This is the least convenient implementation.  \\n\\n\\nAbout one week before pass-off, the TA will supply the students with a pass-off sign up sheet.  You will be required to turn in an electronic copy of your code. However, there are no special code or documentation requirements.\\nGRADING OF PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENTS\\n\\nEach assignment must be completed by the due date or late days will be charged.  The\"*\" indicates functions which you must provide.  All required functionality must be completed.  The balance of points for each section may be earned by completing optional items listed in each category.  You may also propose additional options in writing which, if approved in advance, may count toward the total of optional points.  There are 85 points for each of the four phases for a total of 340 possible points. Note that phase 4 gives you three different options to choose from.  Each option is worth 85 points.  Choose only one of them.  Up to 20 points may be deducted for each assignment if the interface does not facilitate adequate testing of the functionality.  For example, drawing a line must accept start and end points and any other functionality supported such as width, color, etc.  Points will be awarded based on the sophistication and elegance of the functionality.\\nUSE OF OPERATING SYSTEM GRAPHICS PRIMITIVES\\n\\nFor phase 1 (primitives), the only operating system primitives you may use are those that draw individual pixels or clear the screen.  This restriction applies only to the graphics code specified by this assignment.  For the user interface, you may use any operating system or library support available to make your job easier.\\n\\nFor phase 2 and later, you may use built-in operating system or library primitives that draw lines, circles, polygons, etc., so that you can concentrate on implementing the higher level functionality called for in the assignments.\\nRESOURCES\\nMany of the options can be programmed using only information from the text book. Following each option, the page numbers in the text book that cover It are listed in parenthesis. For some options, especially in phase 4, the text book has insufficient detail to allow you to program it without using outside resources.  The reference books cited should prove helpful, and the library has many other graphics books that would be helpful also.  IMPORTANT NOTE: not all of the graphics books are available in the library \"on the shelf\".  Some of the graphics books are kept behind locked doors (some of them include CDs or disks) and you have to ask the librarian to get them for you before you can check them out.\\n\\nFeel free to come in and see the TA during office hours for additional help.  The programming assignments for this class are heavy and the deadlines come up quickly.  It is important to not \"get stuck\" and procrastinate working on the assignment until the deadline is imminent.  If you reach a point where you are not sure how to proceed, It is much better to get some help right away and get going again, rather than wait until deadline panic sets in and it may be too late to catch up.\\n\\n\\n'}\n","{'id': 'http_^^osm7.cs.byu.edu^CS452^CS452', 'pagename': 'CS 452: Database Modeling Concepts', 'content': 'Date: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 21:54:33 GMT\\nServer: NCSA/1.5\\nContent-type: text/html\\nLast-modified: Fri, 18 Oct 1996 14:58:42 GMT\\nContent-length: 2796\\n\\n\\n\\nCS 452: Database Modeling Concepts \\nCS 452: Database Modeling Concepts\\n\\n\\n\\nWelcome to CS 452, Database Modeling Concepts.\\nFor now, this home page for CS 452 only provides you with access to short\\nreference manuals and to news groups of interest to the database community.\\nAs additional useful material is found or created, it will be made available.\\n\\nPlease contact\\nDr. David W.

Pirsig\\n 2. \"Computer Ethics\" - T. Forester, P. Morrison, MIT, 1994.\\n 3. \"Computers in Society\" (5th Edition) - Kathryn Schellenburg, Editor \\n\\nCourse Objectives:\\n\\n\\n1. To provide an opportunity to write about and discuss matters that will have a \\nsignificant impact on your future professional life. \\n\\n\\n2. To build your confidence in your ability to converse with people concerning technical\\nissues and ethics in the information systems environment.\\n\\n\\n3. To demonstrate your ability to analyze and write about and discuss the issues and\\nproblems facing your chosen profession. \\n\\n\\n4. Develop and justify your own personal professional code of ethics. \\n\\n\\n5. To become sensitive to keeping abreast of major new developments in Information\\nSystems and in broadening your perception of your field.\\n\\nSeminar Activities:\\n\\n\\n1.  All reading assignments should be completed before the class period in which the\\nassignment is to be discussed.  This will be a prudent practice since a major part of your\\ngrade will be based on participation in seminar discussions.  I have no preconceived\\ngrade distribution.  It is possible for everyone in the class to get an \\'A\\' grade.  The\\nprocess for doing well is spelled out here in detail.  I only care that there is a fair effort\\ngiven for what ever grade is received.  Fair effort means that in a 3 credit hour course\\nmeeting 2 times a week one should expect to put in at least three hours of preparation\\nfor each meeting period in order to do well.  Since much of the preparation is reading,\\nthe time required will be more for those without rapid reading skills.\\n\\n\\n2.  Write a discovery paper about one page in length covering each reading assignment. \\nThese papers will indicate what you discovered in the reading assignment or within your\\nself as illuminated by the reading assignment.  It is not intended this be a mere\\nsummarization of the articles but a thoughtful analysis of ideas you select.  Be sure to list\\nthe number of your paper using the period #\\'s in the day of the week column in the class\\nschedule.  These papers will be handed in at each seminar. In your format for the paper\\nmake a place for your discussion score in the upper right corner.  Papers need to be\\nmachine printed hard-copy and free of spelling and obvious grammatical errors.  You will\\nbe given feedback on the quality of your writing.  Timely submission is the major criterion\\nfor the discovery paper grade.  If turned in at the discussion period when due they will\\nreceive \\'3\\' points for a \\'quality\\' paper.  Papers lacking in \\'quality\\'(lacking thoughtful\\nanalysis, spelling or obvious grammatical errors) will receive \\'2\\' points.  If you must miss\\na seminar you may receive a negotiated level of credit for the paper if advanced\\narrangements are negotiated with me.  If no advanced arrangements are made the late\\npaper will only receive \\'1\\' point.  Of course no paper no points.\\n\\n\\n3. Come to seminar prepared to discuss your discovery paper and/or the reading\\nassignment.  Regular seminar meeting times will be used to discuss concepts and\\ninsights from your discovery papers for each day\\'s reading assignment.   The major\\nvariable in the determination of grade in this seminar will be the score you assign yourself\\nfor your participation in the discussion.  Participation in the discussions will be self graded\\neach day and the score for the day\\'s discussion will be handed in each period -\\naccording to the following scale: [ \\'0\\' reading assignment not competed - did not\\nparticipate in discussion. \\'1\\' reading assignment not competed but participated in the\\ndiscussion. \\'2\\' reading assignment completed but little or no contribution to the\\ndiscussion. \\'3\\' reading assignment completed and a significant contribution to the\\ndiscussion that relates to the reading assignment.]  A \\'3\\' discussion score may not be\\ntaken for any class at which you arrive late or leave early.  From this grade scale you can\\nsee that your grade is heavily impacted by whether you have read the reading assignment\\neach day.  You may be called upon to justify your score if it varies widely from my\\nobservation of your participation.  This will be accomplished by my changing your score\\non your paper and initialing it.  When you receive the paper back, if you think I have been\\nunfair or overlooked your contribution see me during office hours to resolve the\\ndifference. \\n\\n\\n4. One major writing assignment will be required.  The major writing assignment, which\\nis a report of the development and justification of your own personal professional code\\nof ethics after the pattern of the ACM Code of Ethics.  I\\'ve not seen a good job done on\\nthis paper in less than about ten pages and being a personal code it should be written\\nmainly in the first person.  This paper may be handed in for a preliminary grade on or any\\ntime prior to period # 20.  It will be graded with feed-back and returned as soon as\\npossible.  It can then be resubmitted for an improved grade based on changes needed. \\nThe deadline for this assignment is period # 25.  The turning in of papers for preliminary\\ngrade is optional.\\n\\n\\n5. Writing three summary papers is required as shown in the schedule.

This information\\nwill not be covered extensively in class. It will be your responsibility\\nto read and understand it. \\nA tentative schedule of lecture topics, readings, and examinations.\\n\\nA check-off\\nsheet for lab assignments. \\n\\nSuggestion: Write your name and phone number on the front of\\nyour syllabus so that, if it gets misplaced, it can be returned readily.\\nThe Assignment Check-Off\\nSheet is the only record of your assignment completions. Don\\'t lose\\nit. \\n\\nCOURSE DESCRIPTION and PROCEDURES\\nComputer Science 142 is designed for students who intend to major in\\ncomputer science or in areas having a strong emphasis on computer programming.\\nWhile no prior knowledge of computers is required, the course is a challenging\\none and demands self-discipline and hard work of each student. \\nAlthough Computer Science 142 is not a new course (it has been offered\\nfor many years), the content has undergone extensive revision during the\\npast 3 years. This revision is in response to a new approach to computer\\nprogramming known as Object-Oriented Programming. Object-Oriented Programming\\nis fast becoming the accepted methodology for the design and development\\nof today\\'s large and complex software systems and products. Because there\\nare not yet text books which emphasize Object-Oriented Programming in a\\nfirst computer science course, we have written our own text, \"A First\\nCourse in Object- Oriented Programming.\" In a sense, our new approach\\nis experimental. Many computer science teachers are skeptical about it.\\nWe are cautiously optimistic that we are developing an approach and associated\\nmaterials that will prove to be effective in providing a foundation for\\nobject-oriented program design and development throughout the Computer\\nScience curriculum. We are sure to discover things we will want to change\\nas we gain experience with our new approach. We are anxious to receive\\nconstructive feed back from students concerning the text, the programming\\nassignments, the examples, the order and selection of topics, or any aspect\\nof the class. \\nMany students enrolling in this course have done a little or a lot of\\nprogramming in Pascal or some other programming language. However, it is\\nunlikely that many students have had experience with Object- Oriented programming.\\nIf you have had little or no experience with computers and programming,\\nyou may feel yourself at a disadvantage compared to others who have had\\nprogramming experience. Some students in this situation do well and experience\\nlittle difficulty, while others experience significant difficulty and frustration.\\nEven some students with programming experience may struggle. We will try\\nvery hard to pace the course for beginners and will not let experienced\\nprogrammers divert our lectures or discussions toward advanced or obscure\\ntopics. If you are having trouble understanding the lectures, the reading\\nor the programming assignments, then seek help early and often. TAs in\\nthe lab can help you, your instructor can help you, and you can attend\\na Help section. Help sections for CS 142 are scheduled each semester. Times\\nand locations are posted in the lab. Plan to attend at least one help section\\neach week. A teaching assistant who knows Pascal well will help with design\\nand development of the coming assignment and answer any questions you have.\\n\\n\\n\\nLectures\\nThe purpose of class lectures is to lend structure to the class and\\ntie the concepts together. Instructors will also answer questions and elaborate\\non concepts. However, you have primary responsibility for your education.\\nOther learning resources include weekly help sessions given by lab TA\\'s,\\nthe textbook, and the computers with the Borland Pascal programming environment\\nin the lab. Much of your learning will take place in the computer lab.\\n\\n\\nTexts\\nIn addition to this syllabus, you will need to buy the text: A First\\nCourse in Object-Oriented Programming by Theodore A. Norman. This text\\nis not yet published commercially, but is available as a packet in the\\nbookstore. \\n\\nGrading\\nPoints will be assigned for each program and exam, with programming\\nassignments accounting for 25% of the grade and examinations 75%.

You must attend one of these orientation sessions so that you\\nwill know how the computers work, what the lab procedures are, and how\\nto complete the first lab assignment. \\nEQUIPMENT: The lab currently has several dozen IBM compatible\\nPC\\'s, linked together to a file server disk system using Novell networking\\nequipment and software. \\nDISKETTES: You will need at least one double-sided, double-density\\n3.5\" floppy diskette on which to save your programs. Buy one in the\\nBookstore, better still, buy two, one for a backup copy. You should bring\\nthem with you to Orientation, but it is not critical if you don\\'t have\\nthem yet. You will, however need them before you do any assignments. \\nPOLICIES: Lab policies change somewhat from semester to semester.\\nYou can obtain a current copy of lab policies from any lab assistant. However,\\nthe following rules are always in force, and you will be asked to leave\\nif you break any of them: \\n\\nNo accessing, copying or displaying of pornographic\\nmaterial \\nNo food or drink is allowed. \\nDon\\'t unplug cables or remove computer covers. If you are having problems,\\nget help from a lab assistant. \\nNo games are allowed on the computers at any time. \\nNo word processing. \\nLab assistants give first priority to students with assignments to\\nbe checked off. If you have a program ready to be signed off, hold up your\\nSyllabus as a signal that you are ready. \\nNo illegal copying of software. \\n\\nHELP: Help sections for CS 142 are scheduled each semester. Times\\nand locations are posted in the lab. Plan to attend at least one help section\\neach week. A teaching assistant who knows Pascal well will help with design\\nand development of the coming assignment and answer any questions you have.\\nThese sessions are very important, they will help you to gain problem solving\\nskills and understand how to write the assigned programs. In the lab, the\\nlab assistants will only check\\noff assignments, answer brief questions about program syntax, and help\\nyou in using the computers. TA\\'s will not write your programs for you nor\\ndebug your program logic. The whole point of the lab assignments is for\\nyou to learn how to do these tasks. \\n\\n\\nCOMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS\\nBelow are questions that are repeatedly asked about CS 142. If you don\\'t\\nsee the answer to your question here, review the previous pages or talk\\nto your instructor or lab assistant. \\nIS THERE A WAY TO OBTAIN EXTRA CREDIT? \\nNo. If you have time to do extra credit work, you have time to do an\\nassignment correctly. \\nIS IT OKAY TO STUDY WITH SOMEONE ELSE? \\nYes, group study is very helpful for some. However, don\\'t let someone\\nelse write your programs for you, or you will be unable to pass the tests.\\n\\nWHO MAKES UP THE EXAMS? DO INDIVIDUAL TEACHERS DO THAT? \\nStandard exams are used for all sections of CS 142. The exams closely\\nparallel the programming assignments and text chapter exercises.. \\nWHAT HAPPENS TO MY PROGRAM IF IT IS ONLY PARTIALLY FINISHED AND THE\\nLAB CLOSES, OR I HAVE TO LEAVE? DO I LOSE IT? \\nYou won\\'t lose it if you save it out to your floppy disk. You can then\\nwork on it some more next time you\\'re in the lab. It\\'s a good idea to save\\nyour program periodically as you work even if you\\'re not going to leave\\nthe lab. Some programming errors can cause your work station to hang up\\nso that you must power it off and on to get it working again. When this\\nhappens, you lose everything you did since you last did a save. The Borland\\nPascal IDE provides for automatic periodic saving of the program you are\\nediting. To take advantage of this feature, check the Auto Save Editor\\nFiles box of the Preferences dialog under the Environment option of the\\nOptions menu. \\nWHAT IF I DON\\'T HAVE THE PROGRAM FINISHED BY THE TIME IT IS DUE?\\n\\nYou have ten late days you may use without penalty. Those days could\\nall be used for one assignment, or one day for each of ten assignments,\\nor other combinations. After the late days are used, you will lose a point\\nfor each day subsequent assignments are late. \\nAM I EVER ALLOWED TO PLAY COMPUTER GAMES? \\nNo. Never. Absolutely not. Not even if you\\'re the only person in the\\nlab. \\nCAN I PLAY AROUND ON THE MACHINE JUST TO SEE HOW TO USE IT? \\nYes, by all means do so. Try entering and running the example programs\\nin your text, or modifying your programming assignments once you\\'ve passed\\nthem off. \\nWHAT IF I ALREADY HAVE A DISKETTE? \\nIf you have a 3.5 inch disk, fine. If you are using someone else\\'s disk,\\nmake absolutely sure that he or she is finished with it, and that the disk\\nis formatted for MS-DOS 2.0 or later. If you\\'re buying your own disk, it\\nshould be a double-sided, double-density 3.5\" floppy disk. In any\\ncase, you still need to purchase two Computer Science Materials Cards for\\nthe lab. \\nWHAT IF I HAVE MY OWN COMPUTER? \\nThe lab is currently using Microsoft Windows and Borland Pascal with\\nObjects 7.0 on IBM compatible PCs. If you want to use your own computer,\\nyou should have an IBM PC or compatible (AT&T, Compaq, etc.) and your\\nown copies of Microsoft Windows and Borland Pascal with Objects 7.0. You\\nwill also need to get a copy of the CS142 and Turtles units from one of\\nthe lab TAs. You must still bring your programs into the lab to pass off.\\n\\nWHAT IF I HAVE A NON-IBM-COMPATIBLE COMPUTER? \\nIf you have a Pascal compiler on it, you can use it to learn some things\\nabout Pascal. But it won\\'t have Windows or the CS142 and Turtles units,\\nso you won\\'t be able to write the programming assignments on it. \\nWHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO SCHEDULE TIME IN THE LAB? ALL IN A SINGLE\\nBLOCK, OR IN SEPARATE HOURS? \\nMost people do best if lab hours are spread out through the week, some\\npeople get up-tight if they sit very long at a terminal. We recommend that\\nyou design and write your programs on paper before going into the lab to\\nenter and debug them. \\nWILL CLASSES BE HELD THE WEEK OF EXAMS? \\nYes, always. And be sure not to miss your exams, plan to take the exams\\nat the times scheduled. Only in rare cases will make-up tests be given.\\n\\nWHAT CAN I DO IF I NEED MORE HELP? \\nThree things: \\n\\nHelp sections: a schedule is posted in the lab \\nSee your instructor during his or her office hours. Individual T.A.\\nassistance may be arranged. \\nHire a tutor--the Tutoring Service is run by the Student Academics\\noffice, and free-lance tutors often advertise on bulletin boards and in\\nthe Daily Universe. \\n\\nCAN I SHARE A DISK WITH SOMEONE? \\nNot recommended. You need your own disks. \\nDO THE HELP SECTIONS REALLY HELP? \\nYes. They are very useful in helping students understand how to complete\\nLab assignments. Students who attend usually are very positive in their\\nevaluation of the help sections. One interesting observation: failing students\\nare almost never regular attendees of the help sections. \\nHOW CAN I GET THE MOST OUT OF THIS CLASS? I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE IN\\nLARGE CLASSES? \\nThere is no reason to be wary of large classes. Studies show that, unless\\nthe class is very small (less than a dozen students), the size of the class\\nhas no correlation to the amount of learning that takes place. Much of\\nyour learning will take place in the lab anyway. The best way to learn\\nPascal (or any other programming language) is to write as many programs\\nin it as you can. \\n\\nGo to: \\nCS\\n142 Assignment Check-Off Sheet (Fall 1996)\\n\\nGo to \\n\\nCreated Aug 17, 1994 ... \\nUpdated Mon Apr 10 15:29:47 1995 \\nby Scott\\nS.

Rather than\\nattempting to survey the field of geometric modeling, the purpose of\\nthe course is to allow students to explore several aspects in depth\\nthrough programming and reading recently published articles.\\n\\n\\nThe course will begin with a number of lectures aimed at covering the\\nbasics of techniques based on approximating and interpolating\\npolynomials. Once the basics are covered we'll move into state of the\\nart algorithms addressing various problems such as\\n\\nreconstruction of surfaces from unorganized points;\\n  mesh decimation;\\n  smooth interpolation and approximation for arbitrary topologies;\\n  hierarchical, or multi-level, decompositions of geometry;\\n  interactive techniques for surface design;\\n  meshing for finite element methods.\\n\\nWhat we'll actually get to during the quarter will be determined by\\nthe interests of the participants.\\n\\n\\nA possible list of basic topics to be covered includes\\n\\nSpline Curves: Bezier form, B-Spline form, blossoming,\\n      polar forms, construction, evaluation, differentiation, knot\\n      insertion, subdivision, degree lifting;\\n  Spline Surfaces: Cross product domains, triangular\\n      patches, Bezier form, B-Spline form;\\n  Subdivision Surfaces based on Splines: Catmull-Clark,\\n      Doo-Sabin, Loop, Reif, Peters;\\n  Interpolating Subdivision Curves: Deslauriers-Dubuc,\\n      Donoho, Herley;\\n  Interpolating Subdivsion Surfaces: Dyn.\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nThere will be small programming assignments in the beginning of the\\ncourse to study some of the basic techniques. In the latter part of\\nthe course Students will be required to summarize and present one\\nrecent research paper related to geometric modeling, and to devise and\\ncomplete a programming project that builds upon any of the techniques\\ncovered in class.\\n\\nRecommended Background\\nMathematics: multi-variable calculus, real analysis, linear\\nalgebra.\\nComputer Science: solid programming ability in at least one language\\n(Java, C++, C, Matlab, Maple, Fortran, Mathematica).

It focuses on general networking principles augmented with\\nspecific examples taken from the TCP/IP protocol suite.  At present,\\nthe connected TCP/IP Internet is the largest network in the world,\\njoining approximately ten million machines at universities, government\\nlabs and industrial sites.  Each time you use electronic mail,\\nrlogin/telnet, ftp, or world-wide web (WWW/Mosaic) you\\'ve been using\\nthe TCP/IP protocols.\\n\\nWe will spend time on each layer in the ISO protocol suite.

In the past, I\\'ve given four programming\\nprojects that involve implementing network protocols.  The projects\\nincluded implementing a sliding-window data-link layer protocol,\\ncomplete with checksums, timeouts and retransmissions; implementing\\nboth the client and server sides of remote procedure calls (using\\nSun\\'s RPCGEN facility); and using the \"oracle\" name server to\\ndynamically register network services allowing students to write their\\nown client and server programs and invoke the services provided by\\nother student servers (e.g. using BSD sockets). \\n\\nWarning: I will be updating the course this semester, and plan to\\ncover some aspects of the x-kernel (as described in Peterson & Davie\\'s\\nbook). Thus, the projects described above are likely to change. \\n\\n\\nTexts:\\n\\n \"Computer Networks: A Systems Approach,\" by Larry Peterson and Bruce\\nDavie.

The regional contest will be held on November\\n16th at several sites, this year Duke is a site.  \\nPeople in CPS 149S are expected to participate in the\\ncontest.  The top two teams in the region go to the world finals.\\nThis year's finals will be held in San Jose, CA\\non March 2, 1997.  \\n\\n\\n  Syllabus  \\n \\n\\nEach week three problems will be assigned.  We anticipate ten weeks\\nof problems (with some time off for fall break and for the regional\\ncontest).  Thus a total of 30 problems will be assigned.  We will try to\\nmake one of the problems each week a challenge.  The other two problems\\nwill be easier, but still require an effort to get completely correct.\\n\\n\\n  Grading  \\n \\nCoded solutions will be graded on a scale of 0, 2, 6, 10.  A 10 point\\nsolution solves all input test files correctly.  A 6 point solution\\nsolves some test files, but not all.  A 2 point solution represents an\\nhonest effort at an attempt, but may not solve the problem for any\\ntest data.  An honest effort is subject to interpretation, but we\\nanticipate that it represents at least two hours of work.\\n \\nProblems done individually earn full credit.  For group solutions, the\\npoints earned are split among the group members so that a perfect\\nsolution for a two-person group earns each person 5 points.  \\n \\nTwo cut-offs have been established: 120 points earns an A, 80 points\\nearns a B.  We might lower these cutoffs but we will not raise them.\\nEach student must also make one presentation of a solution.  Failure to\\npresent a solution will cause a 10 point deduction in total points.\\n \\nStudents participating in the regional contest can earn points for\\nproblems solved in the contest.  We may give full credit for all\\nproblems solved to each team member\\nrather than dividing credit among team members.\\n\\n\\n\\n Assignments \\n\\nEach assignment should include a README file with the names of all group\\nmembers (or just one name if an individual attempt) and the time it took to\\ncomplete.

Instead, students are expected to have\\nprior experience programming with functions, arrays, and (ideally)\\nrecords/structs as might be learned in a course using Pascal or C.\\nStudents who do well on the Advanced Placement Computer Science A exam\\n(4/5) or who earn a 3 on the AB exam, should elect this course.  Complete\\n\\n\\ninformation on choosing a first course in computer science is accessble.\\n\\n\\n Texts \\n\\n\\n A Computer Science Tapestry: Exploring Programming and Computer Science with C++ by Owen Astrachan (McGraw-Hill)\\n \\n  Algorithms, Data Structures and Problems Solving with C++\\n by Mark Weiss (Addison-Wesley)\\n \\n (optional)  Introduction to the Public Clusters at Duke \\navailable at Gothic Bookshop\\n \\n (optional)  C++, How to Program  Deitel and Deitel\\n\\n\\n\\n Computing \\n\\nAll programs should compile and execute on acpub Sun workstations.  They\\nshould be compiled with g++ v. 2.7.2.  You will need to alter your\\npath to have access to this version of the compiler.  Sparc\\nClusters are found in Teer 106, 139 Hudson Hall, Soc/Psych\\n133, Bio-Sci 002CC, and Carr 125.  All programs/projects will be\\nsubmitted electronically.\\n\\n Collaboration \\n\\nYou may (and should) work with someone else on programs.\\nYou may  not  collaborate on written assignments or\\nquizzes.  For each assigment you are expected to include a list of\\nconsultants and collaborators as part of the README that must be\\nsubmitted.\\n You may not work with the same person on two consecutive\\nassignments without prior permission. \\n\\n Grading \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nmajor programming assignments\\n\\n\\n30%\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nwritten/minor programming assignments\\n\\n\\n10%\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nlabs\\n\\n\\n8%\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nrandom quizzes\\n\\n\\n6%\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\ntests (2)\\n\\n\\n26%\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nfinal\\n\\n\\n20%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrading is done on an absolute, but adjustable scale.  This means that\\nthere is no curve.  Anyone earning 90% or more of the total number of\\npoints available will receive a grade in the A range; 80% = B, 70% =\\nC, 60% = D. This scale may go down, but it will not go up.  In order to\\nearn an A+ you must do several of the optional assignments.  These points\\ncount even if you don't earn an A+.\\n\\n\\nThere will be several optional assignments.  Completion of these can\\nearn points towards raising a grade by a half-step, e.g., from C+ to B-.\\nIn some cases it may be possible to raise a grade by more than one step.\\nCompletion of some of the optional assignments\\nis mandatory in order to earn an A+.\\n\\n\\nThe tests will be closed-book, the final exam will be open book.\\n\\n\\nRandom quizzes will be given out in class and then flipped-for at the\\nbeginning of the next class.\\n\\n Late Assignments \\n\\n\\nAssignments have an early due date and a final due date.  Normally\\nthese dates will be on Monday (at midnight).\\nAssignments turned in on the early due\\ndate will earn a 10% bonus (based on the total value of the\\nassignment).  \\n\\nAssignments turned in after the final due date are penalized 25%.\\nNo assignment will be accepted more than one week after the\\nfinal due date. Exceptions to this rule may be granted in\\nadvance, but not after the fact.\\n\\n\\n Newsgroup and mail \\n\\nYou should monitor the newsgroup duke.cs.cps100e on a regular\\nbasis.  Information about changes in assignments, due dates, and\\nhints/help will be posted there.  News is the preferred forum for\\nasking/answering questions.\\n\\n\\nYou may want to ask questions by email, this is ok.  If you have a\\nquestion about code, you should submit the code (all relevant files)\\nusing the appropriate submit command and send email.  You should set up\\nacl permission on your cps100e directory for the professor and TA/UTA to\\nhave access to the directory.\\n\\n World Wide Web \\n\\nAll course materials, except for daily notes, are accessible from the\\nclass home page.

If you have\\nsuch a partner, your writeup and final program should still be your own,\\nexcept for the final project(s)  when a group can submit one program.\\nYou must work on your own on written assignments an on minor programming\\nassignments.

You will be given a\\n\"skeleton\" of the operating system and will be asked to implement some\\nof the missing parts, e.g., synchronization primitives for threads,\\nvirtual memory management, and a file system.  You will work on the\\nproject in small teams.  The programming is (almost) in C.  A few simple\\nfeatures of C++ are used; they will be explained as needed.  Here is a\\nbrief overview of Nachos, from its developers at\\nUC Berkeley.\\n\\nNachos is installed locally in ~c536/nachos-3.4 on both the\\nBurrow and the Sharks.\\n\\nProject Mechanics\\n\\nClick above for information on accounts, software tools, etc.\\n\\n\\nGrading\\n\\nThe breakdown is:\\n\\nProject + occasional problem sets 40%\\nMidterm examination 23%\\nFinal examination 37%\\n\\nGrading on the project will emphasize good design as well as working\\ncode.  Graduate students will be asked to implement additional features\\nfound in real operating systems; undergraduates can implement these\\nfeatures for extra credit.  The midterm will be a 75-minute, in-class\\nexam.  The final will be a 2-hour exam held at the time specified in the\\nRegistrar\\'s Schedule of Final\\nExaminations.  The weights of the two exams are in proportion to\\ntheir length.  Both exams will be closed book, closed notes, etc.  The\\nsame exams will be used for 436 and 536, though separate curves will be\\nused to convert numerical scores to letter grades.\\n\\nCourse Newsgroup\\n\\nac.c.436 will be used for both 436 and 536.  If you have questions about\\nthe lectures or the project, this is a good place to ask them, so that\\nother students can benefit from your questions.  If you see a question\\nand (think you) know the answer, post it!  This will help your\\nclassmates and show us that you know what\\'s going on; we\\'ll re-read the\\npostings in the newsgroup when assigning grades.  The instructor or the\\nT.A. will periodically read the newsgroup and post answers or\\ncorrections to answers, if needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWeekly Announcements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWeek of November 18\\n\\nTextbook Readings: Tanenbaum, Chapters 10 and 11 (for this week and next).\\n\\n\\nProject: For Project 4, you can get 15% extra credit by implementing\\nswap-space management that is efficient for sparsely-used address\\nspaces.

This was distributed in the\\ndiscussion section on Sep. 5; if you didn\\'t get a copy, you can print one\\nyourself, or you can ask us to print one.  I recommend reading it even\\nif you are familiar with C++, because it contains some useful stylistic\\nguidelines.  The code for the stack example is in\\n~c536/docs/c++example/.\\n\\n\\n(2) A detailed version of Project 0 was\\ndistributed on Sep. 11.  It is due on Sep. 20.\\n\\nWeek of September 2\\n\\nTextbook Readings: Tanenbaum, Chapter 1\\n\\n\\nProject:\\n\\n\\n(1) Try to form teams by Monday, Sep. 9, so that you can start on\\nAssignment 1 when it is distributed.  As mentioned in the Project\\nMechanics Handout, you should notify us by email when you form a\\nteam.\\n\\n\\n(2) Read the Project Mechanics Page.\\n\\n\\n(3) Start reading the A Road Map Through Nachos and the\\ncode in ~c536/nachos-3.4/code/threads.  Printouts of the Roadmap\\nand the threads code will be distributed on Sep. 4.\\nAnother very helpful resource is Mike O\\'Donnell\\'s Guide\\nto Reading the [Nachos] Source Code.  Mike\\'s Guide is available only\\nin HTML format, so we won\\'t be supplying printouts; this doesn\\'t mean\\nyou shouldn\\'t read it!\\n\\n\\n\\n'}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cs.indiana.edu^classes^c690mac^home', 'pagename': 'Mind and Computation Main Page', 'content': 'Date: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 22:28:43 GMT\\nServer: Apache/1.0.3\\nContent-type: text/html\\nContent-length: 3360\\nLast-modified: Sun, 28 Apr 1996 02:02:49 GMT\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nMind and Computation Main Page\\n\\n\\n\\nMind and Computation Main Page\\nC690: Mind and Computation, 1995-6\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Mind and Computation Seminar features talks\\nby IU graduate students and faculty and occasional visitors on\\ntopics in artificial intelligence, other areas of computational\\ncognitive science, and human-computar interaction.

The goal is an\\narchitecture where these separate components share more by way \\nof common concepts and structures and less through procedural interfaces.\\n\\n\\nThe intention here is to conceptualize and implement multimedia\\nobjects having semantically relevant structure amenable to querying\\nand manipulation, in contrast to current multimedia systems which lack\\nthe database perspective of data independence and associated query\\ncapabilities and to current databases which treat multimedia objects\\nas \"blobs\",  if at all.\\n\\n\\nThe seminar will develop prototype implementations which present\\ndiverse information -- such as movies, sound tracks, and even\\ntraditional relational data -- within a unified conceptual framework\\nand presentation environment.  This implementation will be done by\\nteams who bring a variety of experiences to bear on the multifaceted\\nissues which will arise. \\n\\n\\n\\nLecture schedule (overview)\\n(TOC)\\n\\n\\n\\n Weeks 1, 2, 3: Introduction and Data Modeling\\n Introduction -- relational databases -- algebra, calculus and QBE --\\nobject-oriented databases -- Track data model -- algebra, rule\\nlanguage, and visual language\\n\\n Weeks 4, 5: Digital Media\\n Digital signal processing -- audio -- digital audio -- video --\\ndigital video -- audio compression -- video compression \\n\\n Weeks 6, 7: Data Visualization\\n Mental models - human information processing - Metaphors and\\nanalogies -- Visualizing data: hierarchical, relational, object\\noriented, time-based -- Visualizing queries: boolean, relational,\\nobject-oriented, time-based\\n\\n Weeks 8-11: Student lectures\\n Each student will present a lecture on a topic of their\\nchoice.

However, until recently, information in\\ndocuments was not being used propoerly, because of poor structuring of\\ndocuments. Introduceion to structured documents using \"tags\" or\\n\"markups\" have majorly changed this situation, and tagged electronic\\ntexts are becoming more and more widespread as sources of information.\\n  \\nMarkup languages such as SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language)\\nGoldfarb, Charles 1990 have been introduced\\nfor creating structured documents, but extracting the information\\nbased on the structures in the documents is still not a very simple\\nissue, and in most cases, it is ad hoc and based on primitive word\\nsearches.\\n  \\nThis talk would introduce structured documents and SGML, and discuss\\nsome of the ways of extracting information out of tagged documents. In\\nparticular, some present directions toward this area would be\\ndiscussed, along with examples, advantages and disadvantages.\\n Lincoln Carr: Querying SGML Documents\\n \\nThe Standard Generalized Markup Language, or SGML, and the data type\\ndefinitions, or DTDs, built up from it provide the basis for storing\\ndocuments in a way that allows complex querying.  The Text Encoding\\nInitiative, or TEI, uses SGML to create standard DTDs for such\\ndocument types as poetry and drama.TEI,\\n1994 Currently, TEI has encoded a large body of poetry using its\\nstandards into the English Poetry Database, for which a simple query\\nengine is available.  However, since the poems are not marked up using\\nthe fullest potential of TEI\\'s standard, many useful, more complex\\ntypes of queries are not presently possible.\\n\\n\\n March 1\\n\\n Logic Seminar\\n\\n\\n March 6\\n\\n Bob Penrod: The Evolution of Visualization Tools for Large \\nInformation Spaces\\n \\nLarge information spaces present several problems for\\nvisualization. Such spaces require tools that visualize all the\\nnecessary data and facilitate comprehension of global structure. Most\\ntraditional tools provide a simple window that displays a limited\\nextent of data. This is problematic because (1) not all the data is\\nconcurrently visible, (2) navigation through the data is slow, and (3)\\nno attempt at providing context is made.\\n  The Perspective Wall Mackinlay,\\nJ.D., Robertson, G.G., Card, S.K, 1991 attempts to handle these\\nproblems by integrating detail and context. We will examine two\\nprecursors to the Perspective Wall, \"generalized fisheye views\"\\nFurnas, G.W., 1986 and the \"bifocal\\ndisplay\" Spence, R., Apperley, M., 1982,\\nfocusing in particular on the application of those ideas to \\nlinear information spaces.\\n\\n Weizhen Hu: Interactive Video Technology\\n\\nOrdinary video applications only allow users to access and\\nreplay movies passively. Interactive Video technology\\nintroduced in \\n Yoshinobu Tonomura, et al. 1994\\nallows users to do more operations about the\\nvideo, such as grasping the main idea of the video (fast\\nbrowsing), searching, analyzing, and editing. Three topics are\\ntalked about here: 1. video segmentation and feature extraction;\\n2. Fast Browing method; 3. new video interfaces.\\n\\n\\n March 8\\n\\n Torrin Sanders: Hypermedia Product Evaluation\\n ???\\nXingchun Zheng: An Intelligent Multimedia System\\n\\nHypermedia provides poeple with a new way to combine different media into \\nsingle artefacts.  These can be developed and marketed in the style of \\nconventional media publications.  Multimedia technologies not only being the \\npresentation of data stored as images, sound and video but also allow the \\nincorporation of media specific input modes(eg. natural language, speech, \\npen gesture), and the generation of images, sound and video from more \\nabstract formats. \\nIn Using an Intelligent Agent to Mediate Multibase Information Access \\nW Behrendt, E Hutchinson, \\nKG Jeffrey, CA Macnee, MD Wilson (1993), the MIPS Project \\n (multimedia \\npresentation system) is introduced in the paper as  a presentation of  \\nan open pre-authored hypermedia network stored in the HyTime standard \\nformat with  dynamically created web nodes containing answers to conventional \\ndatabase queries. This illustrates how conventional hypermedia tools can be \\nextended to include intelligent automatic generation of multimedia \\npresentations from retrieved data. An example multimodel system(MMI2) is \\ndescribed to illustrate the technologies which could be brought to the \\nmarket independently. \\n\\nThe above concepts and ideas are still in the research stage.\\n\\n\\n March 20\\n\\n\\nQizhen Zhang: Video-on-Demand and Database Related Issues: An\\nIntroduction \\n \\nVideo-on-demand features a new form of information delivery that is\\ncausing a great commotion in the industries of cable TV,\\ntelecommunications, personal computers, and software.  In this\\nrevolution, multimedia database design and management play an\\nindispesable role.  This talk briefly describes the architecture, the\\ntechnology, and the experimental implementations of this emerging\\napplication.  By means of the description, potential database issues\\nare explored.  As an example, I am going to discuss Network Support for Dynamically Scaled Multimedia\\nData Streams in some depth.\\n\\n Robert Fahey Video Object Servers and Video On-Demand\\n\\nRecently, video on-demand has received quite a bit of attention in the\\nmedia.  However, the media rarely discuss how it will be implemented.\\nIn this talk, I shall examine the requirements needed to support\\nreal-time video, and how current technology meets these requirements.\\nI will also describe several approaches to providing on-demand video.\\nSome issues which will be investigated are: throughput requirements for\\nvideo, throughput and seektime for several secondary storage devices,\\noptimization/organization techniques to improve throughput/response time,\\nand several types of architectures to support video objects.\\n\\nThis presentation is based on five different papers, ranging from continuous\\nmedia storage to the cost effectiveness of Video On-Demand systems.  These\\npapers are: Lougher, P. and Shepherd, D. 1993, \\nRangan, P. and Vin, H. 1993,\\nFederighi, C. and Rowe, L. 1994,\\nGhandeharizadeh, S. and Ramos, L. 1993, and\\nDoganata, Y. and Tantawi, A. 1994..\\n\\n\\n\\n March 22\\n\\n Kaushik Mody: An Introduction to ATM - Asynchronous Transfer Mode\\n\\n\\nComputer networks have revolutionized the way we communicate and\\ninteract the data around the world. However with Distributed\\nMultimedia becoming norms rather than exception, the existing networks\\nare not able to support the high bandwidth and low latency\\nrequirements of its applications. Asynchronous Transfer Mode, a\\nswitching and multiplexing technique is described as a technology that\\nwill allow total flexibility and efficiency to be achieved in\\ntomorrow\\'s high speed, multi-service, multimedia networks.  This\\npresentation is based on the work by  Ronald\\nJ. Vetter; David H. C. Du 1995 and B. G. Kim and P. Wang 1995.\\n\\n Alan Keahey: Multi-Resolution Information Display\\n \\nThis talk will take a look at some techniques for displaying\\ninformation at more than one level of resolution\\nsimulataneously. While similar in scope to the recent talk given by\\nBob Penrod, the focus will be more on the details of hyperbolic or\\nfisheye views, implementation issues, and possibilities for future\\nsystems such as multi-focus systems.\\n\\n\\n\\n March 27\\n\\n Yong Jiang: Matadata in Video Databases\\n \\nVideo is composed of audio-visual information. Providing content based \\naccess to video data is essential for the sucessful integration of video \\ninto computers. Organizing video for content based access requires the use \\nof video matadata. This papter explores the nature of video matadata. A data \\nmodel for video databases is presented based on a study of the applilcations \\nof video, the nature of video retrieval requests, and the features of video. \\nThe data model is used in the architectural framework of a video database. \\nThe current state of technology in video databases is summarized and research \\nissues are highlighted.\\n\\n Aditya Khosla: Towards an optimal operating system for multimedia\\n \\nMy talk will be based on a survey paper that addresses key issues that an operating system\\nneeds to possess in order to efficiently handle multimedia systems. The aspects that\\nI will discuss include Process Management and related scheduling strategies. I will\\nfurther talk about Resource Management , File Management and Memory\\nManagement issues in this context, with  alternative algorithms\\nexamined, and the options that best suit such systems.\\n\\n\\n March 29\\n\\n Chia-Lin Chou: ???\\n\\n Julia Dymshitz:  Approaches to database interface design\\n Approaches to human-computer interaction (HCI) can be broadly\\nclassified into four categories:empirical, predictive modelling,\\ncognitive and anthropomorphic Eberts,\\nR.E. 1994.  Each of these approaches emphasizes a different aspect\\nof HCI, although many research studies fall into more than one\\ncategory. Cognitive and anthropomorphic approaches were applied\\nextensively to database interface design, producing a number of design\\nguidelines.  The usefulness of these guidelines for actual design will\\nbe discussed in the context of advantages and disadvantages of each\\napproach. In addition, two articles (Williams,\\nM.D. 1984 and Eberts, R.E. and Bittianda,\\nK.P. 1993) will be described in greater detail to illustrate the\\napplication of cognitive and anthropomorphic methods to database\\ninterface issues.\\n\\n\\n April 5\\n\\n Arijit Sengupta\\n Lincoln Carr\\n\\n\\n April 10\\n\\n Aditya Khosla\\n Yong Jiang\\n\\n\\n April 12\\n\\n Bob Penrod\\n XingChun Zheng\\n\\n\\n April 17\\n\\n Weizhen Hu\\n Torrin Sanders\\n\\n\\n April 19\\n\\n Kaushik Mody\\n Alan Keahey\\n\\n\\n April 24\\n\\n Julia Dymshitz\\n Chia-Lin Chou\\n\\n\\n April 26\\n\\n Bob Fahey\\n Qizhen Zhang\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProject schedule (overview)\\n(TOC)\\n\\n\\n\\n Week 2: Selection\\n Select a project.\\n\\n Week 4: Proposal\\n Propose the goals for the project\\n\\n Week 6: Iteration 1\\n Write a user manual, implement critical elements\\n\\n Week 8: Iteration 2\\n Refine user manual, implement significant elements\\n\\n Week 10: Iteration 3\\n Implement almost all elements, measure performance\\n\\n Week 12: Iteration 4\\n Restructure (if necessary) and complete the implementation.\\n\\n Week 14: Integration \\n Integrate system\\n\\n Week 16: Delivery \\n Deliver system and user manual\\n\\n\\n\\nProject home pages\\n(TOC)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKiosk Enhancements\\n\\n\\nMovieSpace\\n\\n\\nMovieWall\\n\\n\\nPerformanceTrack\\n\\n\\nTextTrack\\n\\n\\nTrack Database Management System (TDBMS)\\n\\n\\nIf you are new to HTML, you may want to look at \\n\\nA Guide to Authoring HTML Documents.\\n\\n\\n\\nProject deliverables\\n(TOC)\\n\\n\\n\\n February 1\\n Brief proposal\\n February 15\\n\\n\\n User manual\\n The user manual will serve two purposes.  First, it will\\nserve as a guide for the user using your system.  Second, it will\\nserve as a precise specification of your project.

Why should the person reading your\\nmanual read any further?\\n\\n Graphical user interface (for systems with a graphical\\ninterface) \\n What are the different areas on the interface? What elements\\nexist in each area? How is each element manipulated and how does the\\nsystem respond to each manipulation?  What functionalities is the user\\ninterface capable of performing?  How does the user interact with the\\ninterface to achieve each of these functionalities?\\n\\n Programming interface (for systems with a programming\\ninterface) \\n What functions are available?  What do they do?  What parameters\\ndo they take? What is the effect of each parameter? What values are\\nreturned? \\n\\n Implementation: Iteration 1\\n First, identify a set of capabilities to be implemented in this\\niteration.  Second, ensure that your supervisor agrees with you on the\\ncapabilities by February 8. Finally, implement the functionality by\\nthe due date.  \\nHere are some criterion which may be used in choosing the capabilities\\nfor implementation in iteration 1:\\n\\n they must be implementable by the due date,\\n they should constitute a significant element of your system.  \\n they should attack the high risk elements of your system.\\n\\n\\n March 19\\n\\n\\n User manual\\n Complete your user manual to follow the guidelines above.\\n Implementation: Iteration II\\n Implement more than half of the required functionality.\\n\\n April 2\\n\\n\\n Design document\\n Prepare your design document\\n Implementation: Iteration III\\n Implement almost all of the desired functionality.\\n\\n April 26\\n\\n\\n Handin\\n Handin your user manual, design document, and implementation.\\n\\n\\n\\nDevelopment tools\\n(TOC)\\n\\n\\n\\nHere are some starting points for each of the development tools that\\nwill be used in the projects.\\n\\n\\n\\nDigital Media Libraries\\n \\n\\nThe IRIS Media Libraries provide a digital media software development\\nenvironment that includes audio, video, movie and compression\\nlibraries.

Each student is\\nexpected to read and reflect on forthcoming material, and be prepared to help\\nall of us learn more about data communications.  \\n\\n\\nThe instructor and the students will share the lecturing responsibilities,\\naugmented by several presentations by Computer Science staff. Students will\\nwrite at least one survey paper. Those students who present lectures on a\\ntopic will write one paper; other students will write two papers.\\n\\n\\nAs a rough guide, I suggest that your total effort in this course might be\\ndistributed as follows: preparation and follow-up for the course lectures:\\n50%; preparation and presentation of each lecture topic or paper: 25%.\\n\\n\\nI will allocate lecture topics based on the needs of the course and the\\ndesires of the participants. I will attempt to have the lecture schedule\\nfirmed up by the third class period. See the lecture schedule for the current\\nschedule.  \\n\\nEach lecturer will develop and present the topic and will make available a\\nlist of sources and other appropriate materials to allow the members of the\\nclass to prepare for and participate in the lectures. Following your lecture,\\nyou will assign and grade a brief but relevant homework. The lecture topics\\nwill generally follow the structure of our main textbook. Check Guidelines for Lecturers for some hints\\nfor preparing and delivering a good lecture.\\n\\n\\nFor each paper you write, you will propose a topic, and should secure my\\napproval before you commence serious work.  Usually, a paper will be a survey\\nof the present state of a rather tightly focused topic. As a general rule,\\navoid surveys of broad topics. You should plan to treat your topic\\nthoroughly, using the most up-to-date sources you can find. Inevitably,\\nstudents ask how long a paper must be. It is undesirable to make a rule, but\\nI'll say that a typical paper tends to be perhaps 20 double-spaced typed or\\nprinted pages.\\n\\n\\nThe newsgroup for this course is ac.c.623 on the IU\\nComputer Science network. Use the newsgroup to keep tabs on class business\\nand to contribute useful information for the other participants in the class.\\n\\nThere will be no classroom or final exams. On the other hand, you will be\\nexpected to function responsibly at the graduate level throughout the course.\\nOne paper or talk will be due by March 19; the other paper or talk will be\\ndue by April 25. I may choose to interview students on their paper(s). The\\nfollowing factors will contribute to your course grade:\\n\\n\\n Your attendance record (yes, we will take attendance!). You are expected\\nto be present and to participate in all the class meetings.\\n\\n If you lecture: your skill at preparing, organizing, and presenting your\\nmaterial. Where appropriate, this will include your timely preparation of\\nsource lists, handouts, and other documents associated with your\\npresentation. It will also include your skill at selecting and grading\\nhomework problems. I will evaluate your lectures, assign a grade, and upon\\nrequest, offer comments and criticism.\\n\\n Your skill at selecting, researching, and presenting your written\\npaper(s). In addition to doing a proper job on the intellectual content of\\nyour paper, you will be expected to show proper technical writing skills in\\nthe structure, style, and grammar in your paper. I will assign a grade to\\neach paper; the grade will reflect my judgment of writing skills, technical\\ncontent, and appropriateness of topic.\\n\\n Your faithfulness in responding to the homework assignments, and the\\nquality of your responses.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn sum, the success of a seminar course such as this depends on the active\\ninvolvement of the participants, and the quality of your participation will\\nbe a criterion in the grading. For normal, competent work, you should expect\\na B; superior work will earn an A. Inadequate work will earn a C or below.\\n\\n\\nReference sources for data communications and networks\\n\\nThe Swain Library has some books and journals of interest for C623. The\\nlibrary can help you obtain other material through interlibrary loan.\\n\\n\\nOur textbook gives useful references at the ends of its chapters.  \\n\\n\\nI have an extensive collection of textbooks and reference works. Check Prosser's C623\\nbooks for the current list and the conditions under which you may borrow\\nmaterials. \\n\\n Guidelines for Lecturers\\n                                \\nWe will be on a strict time schedule for our lectures, and we cannot afford\\nto get off schedule.  Therefore, you must plan your presentations carefully,\\nand must not assume that you can take portions of the lecture time of others.\\n\\n\\nBe aware of how your topic fits into the total plan. Consult with people\\nwhose topics overlap or touch upon yours. Allocate related or overlapping\\nsubtopics intelligently among your peers. Most of our lectures will cover\\nmaterial presented in the textbook. If you are lecturing mainly from the\\ntextbook, don't plan to cover every subtopic in the book. Pick several\\nimportant subtopics (with the instructor's help, if appropriate), and develop\\nthem in reasonable detail. If you are using sources other than the textbook,\\nhand out a list of sources at least one week in advance of your lecture, so\\nthat others may have a chance to prepare for your lectures. Put your\\nimportant sources on 2-hour reserve in the Swain library. \\n\\n\\nBe prepared to allow up to 2 minutes (but no more!) at the beginning of your\\nfirst lecture for old business. Assign one or two homework exercises related\\nto your topic. Select exercises that will help illuminate important aspects\\nof your topic. Make the homework problems non-trivial, but not too complex or\\ntime-consuming. You will grade the homework for your lecture.\\n\\n\\nUse overhead foils or the chalkboard, as you prefer. The department will\\nprovide 10 overhead transparencies for your lecture, if you choose to use\\nthem. You will make the transparencies yourself, either by drawing directly\\non foils or by photocopying. Prior to your lectures, prepare handouts for\\ndistribution, if appropriate.\\n\\n\\nWhen using overheads, don't use too many, and don't crowd too much\\ninformation into each foil. The pace of a lecture is considerably faster with\\noverheads than with the chalkboard, and you must allow your audience time to\\nabsorb the material, take notes, and develop questions. \\n\\n\\nWith a well-prepared lecture, it is common to have too much material. You\\nmust organize and prioritize your material so that you can fit within your\\nallocated time without rushing! If toward the end of the lecture you see that\\nyou won't finish all the good stuff you've prepared, don't try to rush on\\nthrough new topics. You will give a much better lecture if you deal with your\\npresent (presumably important) topic properly than if you rush to present a\\nquickie sketch of the remaining material. Watch the time! \\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, beware of trying to get by with insufficient preparation.\\nIf you find yourself out of material with 30 minutes remaining in the class,\\nyou will be embarrassed and the class will be irritated. And if you don't know\\ntwice as much as you plan to present and if you haven't practiced your\\npresentation, you may find yourself fumbling at the chalkboard and botching\\nyour examples. If you need help in judging how much material is appropriate,\\nI'll be glad to discuss it with you.\\n\\n\\nYou should encourage questions and discussion. You are not expected to be an\\nexpert in your topic, but you should be sufficiently prepared to lead the\\ndiscussion. If there are unanswered questions, you should investigate them\\nafter your lecture and be prepared to address them next period. If your\\nfollow-up discussion will take no more than 2 minutes, it can be made\\nverbally at the beginning of the next class meeting.  If it requires longer,\\nthen prepare a brief written response to hand out to the class.\\n\\n\\n\"}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cs.indiana.edu^classes^c607^c607', 'pagename': 'SE Management', 'content': 'Date: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 22:32:07 GMT\\nServer: Apache/1.0.3\\nContent-type: text/html\\nContent-length: 736\\nLast-modified: Fri, 23 Aug 1996 16:42:35 GMT\\n\\nSE Management\\nB665-6 Software Engineering Management\\n\\n Syllabus\\nCurrently a PostScript document containing\\n\\n \\n General description of the course and the requirements:\\n   \\n class participation, including leading one or two discussions\\n    literature survey paper\\n    supervision of P465-6/P565-6 project teams\\n   \\n discussion of Team Management,\\n    especially in the context of P465-6/P565-6.\\n\\n   Milestone Responsibilities for each of\\n    the P465 milestones.\\n\\n   An egregiously out-of-date Bibliography\\n    (think of it as a historical survey).\\n\\n\\n'}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cs.indiana.edu^classes^c599^semplanf95', 'pagename': 'C599: Teaching in Computer Science', 'content': 'Date: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 22:32:10 GMT\\nServer: Apache/1.0.3\\nContent-type: text/html\\nContent-length: 2581\\nLast-modified: Fri, 18 Aug 1995 15:13:46 GMT\\n\\nC599: Teaching in Computer Science\\nC599: Teaching in Computer Science\\nComputer Science Department\\nSyllabus for Fall Semester, 1955\\n\\nThe Seminar on Teaching in Computer Science for Associate Instructors\\nwill meet on Thursday evenings from 7:30 p.m. to 8:45 p.m. in Lindley\\n102 during the Fall Semester of 1995.

The emphasis is on\\nfundamental properties of computer systems that apply across a broad range of\\ncomputers and systems. The abstractions are reinforced in class and in the\\nlaboratory.  In the laboratory students extend their problem-solving skills\\nby working at the level of computer assembly language using a modern\\nmicrocomputer system such as the 68000. Although the class and laboratory\\nproceed on their own schedules, the lab applies many of the fundamental\\nconcepts dealt with in lecture, and the lecture provides the foundation for\\nthe lab.  Both class and lab emphasize a disciplined, structured approach to\\nprogramming.\\n\\n\\nTopics are selected from the following list. Topics marked with a star (*)\\nmight be included in an honors course. \\n\\n\\n\\nNumber systems and arithmetic:\\n\\nConversions among various number bases such as decimal, binary,\\nhexadecimal, and arbitrary base. Integer and fraction conversions.\\n\\nNumber representations for signed arithmetic: signed magnitude, two\\'s\\ncomplement, one\\'s complement, floating point.\\n\\nComputer arithmetic: addition, negation and subtraction, simple binary\\nmultiplication, floating-point addition.

Relationships among\\nlanguages, properties and features of languages, and the computer\\nenvironment necessary to use languages.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nThis course provides an introduction to the foundations of programming\\nlanguages, allowing a thorough understanding of programming language\\nsemantics and critical implementation characteristics.  This provides\\nthe basis for the best choice and use of existing languages, as well\\nas language design.  \\n\\nInterpreters and other language-processing\\nprograms are used throughout to present the essential elements of\\nprogramming languages in a precise, analytic, manner.  The extensive\\nuse of interpreters in this course also develops skill in\\nmeta-linguistic abstraction -- a powerful programming paradigm.\\n\\nTo thoroughly understand programming languages (or most any topic), it is\\nnecessary to have a variety of models, or views, at varying levels of\\nabstraction.  In this course we will employ a range of models from very\\nhigh-level (almost mathematical semantics) to very low-level (almost\\nassembly language), and emphasize the connections between levels.\\n\\nScheme is used as a meta-programming language throughout the course, but\\nthis course is about fundamentals that are the basis for most programming\\nlanguages, not just Scheme.  Special attention will be given to modeling\\nthe semantics of the Java language via a series of type checkers and\\ninterpreters.\\n\\n(A slide presentation, available in condensed form summarizes these points and others.)\\nTopics include\\n\\n Induction, Recursion, and Scope\\n Direct semantics interpreters\\n Continuation-passing style\\n Continuation-semantics interpreter\\n Imperative form and stack architecture\\n Static and dynamic semantics for object-oriented programming\\n Object-oriented run-time architecture\\n\\n\\nMaterials\\n\\n Required\\n Essentials of Programming Languages, by Friedman, Wand and\\nHaynes.\\nThis text, known hereafter as EOPL,\\nshould be available in any of the three big textbook\\nbookstores (T.I.S, Aristotle's or the I.U. Bookstore), but you may get\\nit cheaper if you can find a grad or undergrad student who's\\ntaken C311 or C511 and is willing to part with it.\\n\\n Recommended\\n The Little Schemer, by Friedman and Felleisen.\\nThis should also be available in the bookstores, and a couple copies\\nare on reserve in the Swain Hall library.\\nThe Little Lisper is older, but similar.\\n\\n Other\\n \\nOther materials may be required through the semester.  These\\nmaterials will be announced in class and will be made available\\nthrough the White Rabbit on Indiana (near Kirkwood) and will cost a\\nfew dollars to cover copying costs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSyllabus\\n\\nRead the indicated material for each week before the week begins!\\nYou are not expected to understand the material on first reading, but\\nhaving read it once first you will be much better prepared for class and\\ndiscussion sections.

Usually, a\\nproblem or set of problems will be given out at the beginning of\\ndiscussion section and the class will be broken up into small groups\\nto solve the problems.  The AI leading the discussion section will go\\nbetween groups answering questions and asking questions about\\nthe work done so far and about the class material.  Your answers to\\nthese questions, and your progress on the problems given in discussion\\nsection, will count toward your final grade. \\n Some lectures may also be conducted in this manner, and some other\\nlectures will present material not found in the book.  Don't miss\\nclass! \\n\\n\\nAssignments\\n For the most part, assignments will be handed in by email to an\\nautomatic checker with feedback emailed back almost immediately.\\nAssignments may be prepared on the system of your choice, but should run\\nproperly using Chez Scheme version 5.  Homework will be graded by hand,\\nbut the automatic checker will detect some errors. \\n An assignment will usually be given each week.  Assignments will\\nbe added to the list below by 5:00P on Friday and due before 5:00P the next\\nFriday.

It is assumed that you have taken C211 here\\nat Indiana, and so are familiar with the Scheme programming language.\\nThe particular skills needed are the ability to program in a symbolic\\nprogramming language and the experience of programming with recursion.\\n\\nTextbook\\n\\nWe will use the textbook Logic and Discrete Mathematics by\\nWinfried Karl Grassmann and Jean-Paul Tremblay (Prentice-Hall, 1996).\\nAt this time the text book is on order; it has not arrived at the book stores\\nyet.\\n\\nCourse Description\\n\\nThe mathematical foundations of computer science differ somewhat from\\nfrom those of the physical and social sciences.  The study of computation\\nhas two main branches, performance and meaning.  In formalizing\\nperformance we focus on combinatorics and statistics, whose foundations\\nare included in \"traditional\" mathemematics.  In formalizing meaning\\nwe draw more heavily on logic, both as a way to express ideas about programs\\nand as a discipline for describing what computers are and what they do.\\n\\n\\nComputation takes place in a discrete  digital  domain where all\\nphenomena ultimately reduce to binary 1s and 0s.\\nTo explore this universe we need different mathematical tools than are\\nused by physicists and chemists.  We use  induction  far more\\noften than differentiation or integration, for example, and will see\\nnumerous styles of inductive reasoning in this course.  We will also\\nexplore discrete mathematical structures, trees and other graphs, that\\nare prevalent in computing.\\n\\n\\nThe main goal of the course is to improve each participant\\'s ability\\nto conduct a rigorous mathematical argument, that is, to do proofs.\\nOne reason (not the only one) we look at logic in this course is for the\\npurpose of evaluating proof narratives.  A central idea of this course\\nis that \"doing a proof\" and \"programming\" are pretty much the same activities.\\nThe better you are at proving, the better programmer you will be.\\nMore important, the better computer scientist you will become.\\n\\n\\nI plan to follow the text book, except for Chapters 4 (Prolog),\\n8 (Specification in Z), and 12 (Relational Database Systems).  I may\\nhave to skip more chapters, depending on our progress through the material.\\nI may also introduce some topics from later chapters as we go along.\\nThere are a few topics not in the text that we may look at, again, if there\\nis time.  In any event, I will cover all the material of a core 251 course.\\n\\nSyllabus and supplementary material \\n\\nOne or two weeks will be devoted to each of the chapters listed below.\\nSupplementary material is (or will be) included below the chapter listing in\\nsome cases.

Aho and Jeffrey D. Ullman, Foundations of Computer\\nScience, C Edition,  Computer Science Press, New York, 1994.\\n\\nCourse Description\\n\\nAlmost every course in computer science uses concepts from\\nmathematics.  It is the aim of this course to present many of the\\nmathematical topics that are frequently encountered while learning\\ncomputer science.  \\n\\nThose who have taken C201 using\\nScheme know the importance of recursion in programming.  We start by\\nexamining in more detail the concept of recursion in Chapter 2 entitled\\n\"Iteration, Induction, and Recursion.\"  In preparation for study in the\\nanalysis of algorithms, we shall look at the big-Oh notation in\\nChapter 3. \\n\\nThroughout mathematics we find that graphical representation of ideas\\nmake them easier to comprehend.  The same is true in computer science,\\nand we next go to Chapter 5 to discuss special graphs, called trees,\\nas they are used as a data model in computing.  Sets are another\\nimportant mathematical concept underlying much of computer science,\\nand these are treated in Chapter 7.  Those who work in database theory\\nknow the importance of the relational databases.  We next study\\nfunctions and relations from a set theoretic point of view.  Chapter 9\\npresents a more general discussion of graph theory than the previous\\ndiscussion of trees.  Logic underlies all of computer science.  We\\nnext cover propositional logic, which makes up Chapters 12 and 14 of\\nAho and Ullman.  If time permits, in the last part of the course we\\nshall investigate finite state automata, a way of modeling\\ncomputation.  This material is is contained in Chapter 10. If time\\npermits, we shall also discuss Turing machines and the halting\\nproblem.  \\n\\nNote that we have skipped many of the chapters in our text.  We shall\\nalso skip over many of the sections within chapters.  This text is\\ndesigned for a year-long course which introduces students not only to the\\nfundamental ideas underlying computer science but also to the important data structures used in computing.  It would be nice to have enough\\ntime during the semester to cover the whole text, but since this is\\nnot the case, and since the material that we skip is so interesting,\\nyou might consider reading some of the sections or chapters we skip\\nto get a head start for some of the future courses.   \\n\\nHomework assignments will be posted to the class web page regularly,\\nusually due the next discussion section.  Late\\nassignments will not be accepted. Please write your solutions to\\nthe problems in a way that will be easy for the graders to read and\\nunderstand.  Presentation of the answers is a significant factor in\\ngrading homework.  \\n\\n\\nIn this course, you may discuss assignments with other students.\\n(Do not assume this is true in all your courses!)  We expect\\nyou to actually think through and fully understand assignment\\nsolutions.  We have found that students who copy someone else\\'s work\\nand turn in something they do not fully understand usually do poorly on\\nthe examinations, which carry much more weight in grading.\\n\\nTeamwork in doing assignments is good as long as each\\nmember of the team contributes, and fully understands the assignment.\\nIf you are working with a group, please indicate it on your homework\\npapers.

Aho and Jeffrey D. Ullman, Foundations of Computer\\nScience, C Edition,  Computer Science Press, New York, 1994.\\n\\nCourse Description\\n\\nAlmost every course in computer science uses concepts from\\nmathematics.  It is the aim of this course to present many of the\\nmathematical topics that are frequently encountered while learning\\ncomputer science.  \\n\\nThose who have taken C201 using\\nScheme know the importance of recursion in programming.  We start by\\nexamining in more detail the concept of recursion in Chapter 2 entitled\\n\"Iteration, Induction, and Recursion.\"  In preparation for study in the\\nanalysis of algorithms, we shall look at the big-Oh notation in\\nChapter 3. \\n\\nThroughout mathematics we find that graphical representation of ideas\\nmake them easier to comprehend.  The same is true in computer science,\\nand we next go to Chapter 5 to discuss special graphs, called trees,\\nas they are used as a data model in computing.  Sets are another\\nimportant mathematical concept underlying much of computer science,\\nand these are treated in Chapter 7.  Those who work in database theory\\nknow the importance of the relational databases.  We next study\\nfunctions and relations from a set theoretic point of view.  Chapter 9\\npresents a more general discussion of graph theory than the previous\\ndiscussion of trees.  Logic underlies all of computer science.  We\\nnext cover propositional logic, which makes up Chapters 12 and 14 of\\nAho and Ullman.  If time permits, in the last part of the course we\\nshall investigate finite state automata, a way of modeling\\ncomputation.  This material is is contained in Chapter 10. If time\\npermits, we shall also discuss Turing machines and the halting\\nproblem.  \\n\\nNote that we have skipped many of the chapters in our text.  We shall\\nalso skip over many of the sections within chapters.  This text is\\ndesigned for a year-long course which introduces students not only to the\\nfundamental ideas underlying computer science but also to the important data structures used in computing.  It would be nice to have enough\\ntime during the semester to cover the whole text, but since this is\\nnot the case, and since the material that we skip is so interesting,\\nyou might consider reading some of the sections or chapters we skip\\nto get a head start for some of the future courses.   \\n\\nHomework assignments will be posted to the class web page regularly,\\nusually due the next discussion section.  Late\\nassignments will not be accepted. Please write your solutions to\\nthe problems in a way that will be easy for the graders to read and\\nunderstand.  Presentation of the answers is a significant factor in\\ngrading homework.  \\n\\n\\nIn this course, you may discuss assignments with other students.\\n(Do not assume this is true in all your courses!)  We expect\\nyou to actually think through and fully understand assignment\\nsolutions.  We have found that students who copy someone else\\'s work\\nand turn in something they do not fully understand usually do poorly on\\nthe examinations, which carry much more weight in grading.\\n\\nTeamwork in doing assignments is good as long as each\\nmember of the team contributes, and fully understands the assignment.\\nIf you are working with a group, please indicate it on your homework\\npapers.  If someone has given you a lot of help, acknowledge them;\\nyou will not be penalized and they will get the thanks they deserve.\\n\\n\\nAnnouncements\\n Exam 2--Wed, Nov 13\\n Oct. 23\\n Oct. 3\\n Sept. 30\\n Sept. 17\\n Sept. 16\\n Sept. 13\\n Form of HW\\n Sept. 5\\n\\nHandouts\\nTemplate for \\nstrong mathematical induction.\\n\\nTemplate for\\n(regular) mathematical induction.\\n\\n\\nAssignments\\nNo late assignments will be accepted.\\n Due Mon/Wed 25/27. \\n Due Fri 22. \\n Due Mon 18. \\n Due Mon 11. \\n    Solutions\\n Due Fri 8. \\n    Solutions\\n Due Fri 1. \\n    Solutions\\n Due Mon 28. \\n    Solutions\\n Due Fri 25. \\n    Solutions\\n Due Fri 18. \\n    Solutions\\n Due Fri 4. \\n    Solutions\\n Due Fri 27.\\n    Solutions\\n Due Mon 16. \\n    Solutions\\n Due Mon 9 at the beginning of class.\\n    Solutions\\n Due Wed 4 by the end of the day.\\n    Solutions\\n\\nCommunication\\nE-mail / Office Hours\\n\\nMichael Jahn \\nmjahn@cs.indiana.edu\\nMW 3:00-4:00, LH 301-G\\n\\nKata Bimbó \\n                 kbimbo@ophelia.ucs.indiana.edu\\nWednesday 2:45-3:45 and Thursday 4:45-5:45,  LH 301-I\\n\\n\\nThe course newsgroup, ac.csci.c241, \\nwill be used to post more urgent announcements \\n(such as changes to assignments, exams, and any exceptions \\nto our usual office hours)  \\nto ensure that people can get \\nthat info even if they don\\'t have a web browser at home, but can read\\nthe newsgroup.

The study\\nof computer programming is therefore the study of solving problems with\\na computer, but it is also much more.  When a programmer writes a\\nprogram, he or she is actually constructing a model of a process\\nfor doing something---such a model is called an algorithm.\\nFurthermore, the programmer is concerned not only with whether the\\nprogram simply works, but also with how well it works and how it\\ninteracts with both users and other programs.\\n\\nThis class is designed mainly to teach you the art of computer\\nprogramming.  To that end, we shall try to develop in you a sense of\\nstyle and aesthetics that will help guide your programming efforts,\\nand we shall try to develop your intuition about how things work and\\nwhy.  You will learn some of the design principles that go into the\\nengineering of good programs.  We shall teach you a little\\ncomputer science, to give you a way of analyzing your programs\\nand your algorithms and finding the means to improve them.  You will\\nlearn a number of standard algorithms and some programming \\nidioms--standard ways of performing certain kinds of tasks.\\n\\nTo do any programming, we need to choose a language. \\nWhichever we choose, the language does not place limits on what our\\nprograms can do, but only on what they look like.  It provides us\\nwith a framework in which to organize our ideas about processes and\\nproblem solving.  The programming language we use in this class is\\nScheme.  We have chosen it because it provides a convenient mechanism\\nfor describing most of the idioms and processes that programmers have\\nfound useful.  We won\\'t spend much time teaching the details of the\\nlanguage, because we don\\'t have to; you will find that it is easy to\\npick up as we go along.\\n\\nIt is often helpful to first program using a simple, powerful language\\nlike Scheme, even if one must then translate the solution into a more\\ntraditional programming language like C++.  The simplicity of Scheme\\nallows us to treat many computer science topics in more depth than\\nwould be possible if C or C++ were used, for in traditional languages\\nmore inessential detail must be mastered.  Scheme allows us to give a\\nbetter impression of the true joys and challenges of programming.\\nThen you will be in a better position to study C++ in your next\\ncomputer science course, C212.\\n\\nFinally, computer programming is still a fairly young field, and it\\nhasn\\'t lost its sense of fun for lots of people, including us.  We\\nhope that you will enjoy it as much as we do.\\nGoals\\n\\nAt the end of the course, a student can be expected to know the\\nfollowing concepts and to be able to write good Scheme programs.\\n\\n\\n The students should be able to use the following data types:\\nsymbols, numbers, booleans, lists, vectors and matrices, strings, and\\ncharacters.\\n The students should know how to write programs in recursive,\\niterative, and imperative styles.  \\n Students should be able to write recursive programs on\\nlists, both those containing only top level items and those containing\\nnested sublists (tree recursion).\\n The students should be able to use procedures as first-class\\nobjects, that is, pass them as arguments and also write programs whose\\nvalues are procedures.  This includes the currying and composing of\\nprocedures. \\n The students should understand the concept of scope and\\nenvironment.  They should be able to use locally-defined procedures.\\n Students should be able to use abstraction, both with data in making\\nprograms independent of the data representation, and also with\\nprocedures in abstracting the structure of programs.\\n Students should be able to use the input and output routines, and\\nwrite convenient user interfaces for their programs.\\n Students should be able to handle the binary representation of\\nnumbers.\\n Students should know some of the standard sorting routines, e.g.,\\ninsertion sort (O(n^2)), mergesort and quicksort (O(n log n)), and\\nunderstand the advantages and disadvantages of each.  They should also\\nbe able to write both linear and binary search programs.\\n Students should know how to mutate various data structures, including\\nlists, vectors, strings.  In addition they should understand\\nside-effecting variables.\\n Students should be able to read programs and have an appreciation of\\nwhat constitutes good programming style.  They should be aware of the\\nrelative efficiency of programs.\\n Certain topics will be included if time permits.  These include such\\nthings as writing and using syntactic extensions, developing an\\nobject-oriented programming package in Scheme, and using streams.\\n\\nLiterate programming\\n\\nEvery programmer knows that programs must be comprehensible to the\\ncomputer.  The programming language implementation complains when they are\\nnot. But with some practice it is generally easy to solve such problems.\\n\\nWhat is less appreciated is that programs must also be comprehensible to\\nthe programmer.  Otherwise the programmer cannot have any confidence that\\nthe program is correct.  (A program may easily be comprehensible to the\\ncomputer, but not do what is intended--and only the programmer knows what\\nis intended.)  In most cases it is also essential that programs be\\ncomprehensible to other programmers.  Though this is not typical of student\\nprogramming experience, in the \"real world\" programmers spend most of their\\ntime modifying huge programs that were developed over a long period of time\\nby many other programmers.  Modifying someone else\\'s code (or even your\\nown, a few months later) may be a joy or a nightmare--depending on how\\nclearly the program is written.\\n\\nThus we emphasize the importance literate programming: writting\\nprograms that are easy to understand (relative to the difficulty of the\\nproblem they solve).  Literate programming is almost always more important\\nthan other programming goals such as efficiency and code compactness\\n(though efficiency and compactness are often byproducts of literate\\nprogramming).\\n\\nCourse Materials\\n\\n Required\\n\\n G.

P. Friedman and M. Felleisen, The Little Schemer,\\nFourth Edition, MIT Press, 1996.  This little book is the best\\nintroduction to recursive programming that we know of, and is designed\\nfor self study.

It is\\nrecommended that you use the UCS (University Computing Services)\\nmachines named copper and zinc.  New students should\\nhave a Network ID and instructions for creating copper and zinc\\naccounts. \\n \\nAs soon as you have your account, you should configure it to run\\nemacs, Scheme within emacs, and the handin program.  This is done by\\nentering ~c211/setup, hitting return, and logging\\nout.  You only have to do this once!  When you login the next\\ntime, your account will be configured for C211.  You have to configure\\nboth your copper and zinc accounts.   \\n\\nAssignments will be posted on or before Wednesday afternoon and will\\nbe due electronically by 5:00 p.m. on the Wednesday of the following\\nweek.  Any written material will be due at the beginning of the\\nlecture on that Thursday or Friday.  Late assignments will not be\\naccepted!  In computing the semester assignment average, the lowest\\nassignment grade will be dropped.  Although assignments count for only\\n10% of the final grade, it is essential that you do the assignments to\\nmaster the material.  Computer programming, like playing a musical\\ninstrument, can only be mastered through lots of practice.\\n\\nProgramming assignments are submitted using the program\\nc211-handin (in the directory ~c211/bin on\\ncopper and zinc).  The handin program evaluates and grades your\\nprogram\\'s behavior and the results are returned to you almost\\nimmediately via email.  Since zinc allows e-mail to be sent\\nbut not received, you will have to read the grading results on the\\nmachine where you normally read your mail.  You may correct and\\nresubmit your programs as many as five times until the announced\\ndeadline.  The highest grade recorded for the assignment will be the\\none that is entered into the class gradebook. \\n\\nIn this course, you may discuss assignments with other students.  (Do\\nnot assume this is true in all your courses!)  We expect you to\\nactually think through and fully understand assignment solutions.  We have\\nfound that students who copy someone elses work and turn in something they\\ndo not fully understand usually fail the examinations and the 10% added by\\nhaving good assignment grades is insufficient to pass the course.  Teamwork\\nin doing assignments is good as long as each member of the team\\ncontributes and fully understands the programs.  This certainly means\\nthat you should not put your name on a file written by someone else\\nand submit it as your own work. \\n\\nAfter the final submission of an assignment, it will not only be\\nelectronically graded, but an Associate Instructor will also grade the\\nassignment for style.  Good programming style makes it easier to get your\\nprograms working and also develops the habit of literate programming which, as we have already noted,\\nis of great importance in developing large programs.  In this course good\\nstyle is also rewarded in the evaluation of exams.  For Scheme programming,\\nconsistent use of a suitable style of program indentation is essential, and\\nviolation of the first cardinal rule of\\nindentation will automaticaly result in loss of credit.\\nCommunication\\n\\nThe course newsgroups, \\n\\nac.csci.c211 and,\\nac.csci.h211 will be used\\nto post announcements, such as assignments, exams, and any exceptions\\nto our usual office hours.  You are also encouraged to use it to post\\nquestions related to the course or share related information with the\\nclass.  Make a habit of looking for new notes a few times each\\nweek. On individual or personal matters, please feel free to contact your\\ninstructor or associate instructor via email. \\n\\nAnother newsgroup you should check regularly is cs.students, which contains important\\nannouncements from the Computer Science Department to all of its\\nstudents.  It also contains interesting dialogs on various topics.\\n\\nThis course description is accessible as an HTML (hypertext markup\\nlanguage) file on the WWW (World Wide Web) with the URL (Universal Resource\\nLocator) http://copper.ucs.indiana.edu/~c211/home.html.

Introduction\\n Could a computer be conscious? What would a continuous programming language be like?  What kind of \"materiality\" exists on the Web?  How will computation affect the future of science?  What about quantum and DNA computers?  Is it ethical to give computers power over human life?\\n\\n Addressing such questions requires knowing what computers are, and what computation is -- to a depth (it is argued in this course) beyond that reached by current theories.  Come and find out why: what we know, what we don\\'t know, what a more adequate theory would look like.\\n\\n\\nA critical examination of the conceptual foundations of computing,\\nfocusing on:\\n\\n\\nThe models and metaphors in terms of which we understand\\n        computing -- from programs to processes, architecture to\\n        abstraction, parameterization to parallelism; and\\n\\n The use of computational concepts in adjacent fields -- from\\n        cognitive science to physics, economics to art.\\n\\n Initially, we focus on six traditional views: formal symbol manipulation, recursive function theory, effective computability & computational complexity, digital state machines, information processing, and Newell and Simon\\'s notion of a physical symbol system.  Non-standard views are also considered, such as connectionism, non-linear dynamics, and artificial life.  Throughout, each view is judged by its ability to do justice to practice.  We conclude by briefly considering the wider role of computational concepts in intellectual life -- including their affect on our self-conception.\\n\\n\\n\\nB.

Content\\n\\nReading: Primary reading will be selections from the\\n       first 3 volumes of the instructor\\'s forthcoming series of books\\n       on the philosophy of computation (The Middle Distance: An\\n       Essay on the Foundations of Computation and Intentionality).\\n       Supporting material to be selected from Dretske, Dreyfus,\\n       Fodor, Goodman, Haugeland, Hayes, Kleene, Minsky, Newell,\\n       Penrose, Shannon, Simon, Turing, Webb, and others.\\n\\n  Prerequisites: No formal prerequisites; students should\\n       have substantial computational expertise (typically from a\\n       combination of programming and instruction) and familiarity\\n       with conceptual argumentation (typically from one or more\\n       philosophy courses). If in doubt please contact the instructor.\\n\\n  Grading: No midterm or final exam. Three or four\\n       \"problem sets\" will be distributed, each consisting\\n       of a series of structured essay questions (a term paper may be\\n       substituted for final problem set, at the student\\'s\\n       discretion). The notion of a \"right\" or\\n       \"wrong\" answer is considered inappropriate; grades\\n       wil be based on the clarity, imagination, and depth of\\n       answer. Experience suggests that it will take the typical\\n       student ~20 hours to complete each problem set to a grade-A\\n       level.\\n\\n  Format: It is (tentatively) planned that problem\\n       set responses will be submitted on-line,\\n       where they will be graded, cross-referenced, and made available\\n       to other class members.  An on-line discussion of each question\\n       will be conducted after problem sets solutions have been\\n       submitted.\\n\\n  Sections: No formal sections. Students are encouraged\\n       to work on problem sets in groups, provided a list of group\\n       members is included with the response.\\n\\n\\nD.

Wed, 9:00 - 10:00 AM.\\n\\n\\nCourse Description\\nThis course is for students in the sciences and applied mathematics whose research involves solving\\nlarge sparse linear systems on a computer, and for computer scientists interested in learning\\nthe computational problems encountered in scientific and engineering codes.\\nSparse linear systems occur in most large scale physical modeling\\nprograms and often the setting up and solution of them accounts for the majority of the computer time.\\nThis course will focus on practical methods and their computer implementation,\\nwith a minimal amount of the underlying mathematical theory.  \\nHigh level tools will be used in order to quickly implement and test methods.\\nExisting software will also be used whenever possible,\\nto avoid building everything from scratch, and to learn how to use existing software resources.\\nCourse goals include the ability to understand the influence of computer\\narchitecture on the choice of methods and data structures,\\nthe strengths and weaknesses of basic methods, common sources of large sparse linear systems,\\nand the resulting implications for choosing methods and implementations.\\nStudents will finish the semester with a toolkit of solvers that they can\\nthen use for solving scientific problems, for \\nprobing computer architectures, or\\nfor obtaining a deeper understanding of the methods commonly used in\\nscientific computing.\\n\\n\\nTentative Course Outline\\n\\n A quick start: everything you knew about solving linear systems from your linear algebra course.\\n Introduction\\n     \\n Basic linear algebra you haven\\'t seen before\\n         Sources of large sparse linear systems\\n         Computer architecture basics\\n         Data structures and stopping tests\\n     \\n Iterative methods: pre-1972 technology\\n     \\n Linear stationary\\n         Conjugate gradients (CG): theory\\n         CG convergence properties\\n         Preconditioning CG\\n     \\n Computational kernels and software resources\\n     \\n Expressing iterative methods in terms of  kernel operations\\n         Toolkits for sparse system manipulations: Sparskit,  Sparse BLAS\\n         Packages:  PetsC, Aztec, SPLIB, Templates\\n         Finding and using numerical software from the Net\\n     \\n Iterative methods: recent technology\\n     \\n Basic derivation ideas: orthogonalization, restarts, truncation\\n         CG on normal equations\\n         Generalized Conjugate Residuals, Orthomin(m), GCR(m)\\n         Generalized Minimal Residuals, GMRES(m)\\n         Bi-conjugate gradients, CG-squared, CG-Stab, QMR\\n     \\n Preconditioning and related ideas\\n     \\n Scaling/equilibration\\n         Incomplete factorization\\n         Polynomial methods and preconditioning\\n         Other \"preconditioning\" methods\\n     \\n Crafting a solution strategy\\n     \\n Choice of solvers\\n         Choice of preconditioners\\n         Choice of stopping test(s)\\n         Reading  the literature: judicious use of a jaundiced eye\\n     \\n\\n\\nClass Newsgroup\\n\\nThe course newsgroup, ac.csci.b573, will be\\nused to post announcements, assignments, corrections, and any exceptions\\nto usual office hours.  Use it to post\\nquestions related to the course or share related information with the\\nclass.  You are responsible for checking the newsgroup frequently, since\\nany changes or corrections to assignments will appear there.\\n\\nGrading Policies\\nGrades are based on projects involving writing and/or analyzing computer programs.\\nWritten reports are required for these projects.\\nEach assignment will have questions intended to begin your thinking process,\\nnot end it.  Grading will also be based on the questions you raise and answer in these projects.\\nFor example, if the question is \"Which of the methods A and B is faster,\"\\nsimply saying \"A\" is not sufficient.  You should also ask the underlying\\nquestion ``What measure of fast is appropriate here?\\'\\',  \"Why is A faster?\", etc.\\nMost projects you can tackle in groups.  \\nHowever, you must give full attribution for any outside sources you use for ideas, software, or help.\\nAlso, I reserve the right to call on any member of the group to\\npresent/explain/defend/justify the group\\'s work and to base the\\nentire group\\'s grade on that member\\'s performance.  So be careful who you team up with!\\n\\nCheating\\nDon\\'t.  You can get away with virtually any lifting or scavenging of material,\\nprovided you cite the source.  If your citation is \"I photocopied another student\\'s\\nwrite-up\" then you won\\'t get many points on the assignment, but at least you\\nwon\\'t be branded with a scarlet \"P\" and tarred and feathered.\\n\\n\\nAssignments\\n\\nAssignments will be given often; a total of 10-15 will\\nbe given (depending on the chunk size of each one!).\\n\\n\\n  Assignment 1\\n  Assignment 2\\n  Assignment 3\\n  Assignment 4\\nBe sure to make the modifications that were specified in class lecture,\\ndesigned to make your life easier!\\n  Assignment 5\\n  Assignment 6 on GMRES(m).\\n  Assignment 7 on projectors.\\n  Assignment 8 on the composite step\\nCGSTAB algorithm of Chan and Szeto.\\n\\n\\nLecture Notes\\n\\nThis is not a full or complete set of lecture notes; in the\\nwords of a not-so-great philosopher, \"You had to be there\".\\nIf you miss a lecture,\\nbe sure to check with other students in the class for what went on.\\nThese are in Postscript, since latex2html still is not up to snuff\\nfor papers with lots of math symbols.\\n\\n\\n Conventions and Notation\\n Classifications of Problems and Methods\\n Origins of Linear Problems\\n Memory Systems and Performance\\n Pipelining and Performance\\n The BLAS\\n Sparse Matrix Data Structures\\n Conjugate Gradient Algorithm: Part 0\\n Linear Stationary Methods\\n Chebyshev Method and Residual Polynomials\\n Conjugate Gradient Algorithm: Part 1\\n Toolboxs for Iterative Methods\\n Preconditioning: CG\\n Least Squares Problems and Algorithms\\n Nonsymmetric Methods I: GCR, Orthomin, GMRES\\n Preconditioning: Nonsymmetric Solvers\\n MATLAB Information\\n Projectors, Lanczos Algorithm, and Bi-CG Methods\\n An Idiosyncratic View of Nonsymmetric Solvers\\n Basic Matrix Reordering\\n\\n'}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cs.indiana.edu^classes^b551^home', 'pagename': 'B551 Main Page', 'content': 'Date: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 22:33:14 GMT\\nServer: Apache/1.0.3\\nContent-type: text/html\\nContent-length: 9504\\nLast-modified: Tue, 19 Nov 1996 02:25:34 GMT\\n\\n\\n\\nB551 Main Page\\n\\n\\nB551: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n Professor: David Leake (E-mail: leake@cs.indiana.edu).  \\nOffice hours Tuesday and Thursday, 2:30-3:45, LH230D.\\n Associate instructor: Kyle Wagner \\n(E-mail: elyk@cs.indiana.edu).\\nOffice hours Monday 1:30-3:00, Wednesday 1:00-2:00, LH330i.\\n\\nContents\\n\\nWhat\\'s New\\n\\n\\n Administrative information  \\nEveryone is responsible for reading the following pages.  \\n\\nOverview\\nof class policies\\nSyllabus\\nDepartmental\\nstatement on academic integrity \\n\\n\\n Class-related information \\n\\nHomework assignments\\nReading assignments \\nGuidelines\\nfor programming assignments \\nMaterials on reserve at Swain library \\nClass Newsgroup \\n\\n\\n Other assorted pointers \\n\\nA sample RAP with some notes\\nReferences for\\nthe Frame Problem collected by David Chalmers.\\nSchedule for \\nMind and Computation Series  talks\\nAI/Cog Sci societies \\nOther Web Sites of Interest \\nMailing list for local (IU) Cog Sci announcements\\nand discussion \\nOther relevant newsgroups \\nLoebner prize rules \\nJulia, a 1994\\nLoebner competitor (Julia discusses cats)\\nUseful scheme references \\n\\n\\nWhat\\'s New\\n\\n Homework 5 posted, 11/14\\n A sample RAP with some notes posted on 11/14\\n\\n\\nHomework assignments\\n\\n Homework 5, Due Nov. 22\\n Homework 4, Due Nov. 8\\n Homework 3, Due Oct. 17  and\\nsolutions.\\nHomework 2, Due Oct. 10  and solutions\\nHomework 1, Due Sept. 24.

MIT and\\nMcGraw-Hill, 1990 (Fifteenth printing, 1995)\\n\\n\\nA clarification: This course does not have\\nprogramming projects.  However, if you like programming, you should\\nknow that algorithms are written as pseudo code and, if you are good\\nat them, you can turn them into real code easily.  These algorithms\\nare used in many applications, and there are programs written for them\\nalready.  You may play with those programs if you like, but you will\\nhave to know the algorithms to understand how the programs work.\\n\\nTentative Course Outline\\n We will first introduce analysis of algorithms.  This includes\\nasymptotic notation, summations and recurrences, counting and\\nprobability, lower bounds.  They will not be introduced in abstract,\\ninstead we will discuss sorting and related algorithms (insertion\\nsort, mergesort, quicksort, heapsort, median and order statistics) as\\nwell as Strassen's matrix multiplication algorithms (Parts I-II:\\nchapters 2-4, 6, 7-10, 31.2)\\n\\n We will then discuss data structures.  They include hash\\ntables, binary search trees, red-black trees, skip lists, and\\naugmenting data structures.  The last piece will start the study of\\nalgorithm design, although some design techniques (recurrence,\\ndivide-and-conquer) will have been covered while introducing analysis\\ntechniques. (Part III: chapters 12-15)\\n\\n We will then study advanced algorithm design techniques\\n(dynamic programming, greedy algorithms) and analysis techniques\\n(amortized analysis).  These techniques will not be introduced in\\nabstract, instead we will discuss problems such as longest common\\nsubsequence, activity selection, and minimum spanning tree.  This last\\nexample will start study of graph algorithms.  (Part IV: chapters\\n16-18, 24)\\n\\n We will then discuss graph algorithms.

If you take the Tuesday/Thursday lecture (Section 1108), you are encouraged to take the Thursday lab (Section 1110). Students who follow this scheme will get the most out of both the lecture and the lab.\\n\\n\\n  General Course Goals. \\n\\nI hope to accomplish several things in this course. Since this is the first time we\\'ve done it, it\\'s impossible to predict just how much we will be able to cover.\\n\\nIn general, there are two areas I want cover: the technical and the practical. In many cases, these are related, but not always. The technical amounts to the \"how to\" aspect of any class. We want to learn how things work and how to use them.\\n\\nThe practical is more ethereal. It\\'s the sort of thing you can\\'t or don\\'t usually get in technical classes. Ideas about problem solving, professional growth and development on-the-job, all those things you need to know about if you\\'re really going to do network administration as all or part of your job.\\n\\n  \"Technical\" Course Goals.   \\nThe technical goal of this course is very practical in nature. We want you to learn about networks.  This includes (some) hardware, Networking Topologies, Networking Protocols, Network Operating Systems, and Desktop Operating Systems.\\n\\nWhen you complete this course, you will have worked to some degree with: Novell Netware 3.12, Windows 3.1, Windows95, Windows NT Workstation, Windows NT Advanced Server, and Macintosh OS. You will have a \"working knowledge\" of these systems (some more than others).\\n\\n\\nI will try to make this experience as practical as possible, using what I know about systems currently in place in both business and education, so that when you are done, you can honestly say you have some useful networking knowledge and experience.\\n\\n\\n Grading. \\nUghhh! I know this is never fun, but here\\'s what I have in mind at this point. There will probably be weekly or bi-weekly homework assignments that will be graded and represent 15-25% of the course grade.\\n\\n\\nThe labs will probably not be graded, since the goal is use and hands-on experience. However, what you do in the labs will appear on the exams or homework, or both, so you\\'ll still have to learn this stuff.\\n\\n\\nThere will probably be 3-4 exams, representing 75-85% of the course grade, evenly distributed across all the exams. So, there will probably not be a so-called comprehensive final. Instead, the 3rd or 4th exam will take place during the final exam time. However, it\\'s my custom to design my classes so each \"section\" builds on the previous. In other words, even though the last exam won\\'t be a final, it\\'s unlikely you\\'ll pass it unless you\\'ve done well on the previous exams, labs and homework. You\\'ll have to know what we\\'ve already learned to keep up.\\n\\n\\n\\n Finally ... \\nDon\\'t let any of the above scare you away. I just wanted to be sure anyone enrolled in the course this semester or interested in this course in the future has a decent amount of information to make an informed decision.\\n\\nIn response to the demand for this course, at this time it appears it will be offered every semester. At this time, two sections of this course will be offered during Spring 1997.\\nNOTE: ERROR IN THE PRINTED SCHEDULE OF CLASSES\\n\\nThe Wednesday lab, Section 1109, meets from 10:10 - 11:00, NOT 9:05-9:55.\\nIf you take the MW lecture, you are encouraged to take the W lab. If you take the TR lecture, you are encouraged to take the R lab. Students who follow this scheme will get the most out of both the lecture and the lab.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\njwhitmer@cs.indiana.edu\\n'}\n","{'id': 'http_^^copper.ucs.indiana.edu^~a202^home', 'pagename': 'A202 Course Description', 'content': 'Date: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 22:33:56 GMT\\nServer: NCSA/1.4.2\\nContent-type: text/html\\nLast-modified: Fri, 19 Apr 1996 15:16:06 GMT\\nContent-length: 3917\\n\\nA202 Course Description\\nA202/A502 -- Introduction to Programming II -- Spring 1996\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this course, we will study the more advanced features of the C++\\nlanguage, new programming techniques and paradigms, and data\\nstructures. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Syllabus\\n Roster\\n Student Homepages\\n Contents of this page:\\n\\n What\\'s New\\n Programming Projects\\n Reading Assignments\\n Lab Exercises\\n Cool Stuff\\n\\n\\nWhat\\'s New\\nImplemented as a \"forgetful stack\": \\n\\n  4/19 -- Posted a solution to \\nQuicksort.\\n\\n  4/18 -- \\nDo the \\nElectronic Course Evaluation!!\\n\\n  4/18 -- Project 8:  Trees.\\n\\n 4/11 -- Posted a solution to Spin\\nOut.\\n\\n Some classic examples of recursion:\\n\\n Towers of Hanoi\\n Merge Sort\\n\\n 4/2 -- \\nComputer Science and Information Technology\\n\\nProgramming Projects\\n\\n Screen Saver\\n Adventure Game\\n Undoing Commands\\n Projects -- implementation vs. application\\n\\n A Queue Class\\n Computer Simulation\\n\\n A Linked Queue Class\\n\\n Stretchy Stack\\n Linked Stack\\n\\n Spin Out and a Solution\\n Quicksort and a Solution\\n\\n Towers of Hanoi\\n Merge Sort\\n\\n Trees\\n\\nReading Assignments\\nIn reverse chronological order: \\n\\n Pointers and operator overloading: handout\\n Linked Lists: F&K, 16.6 and 16.7\\n Creating Software Components: Budd, Ch 2\\n Classification of Collections: Budd, Ch 5\\n Queues: Budd, 9.5.1\\n Pointers: Read section 13.1 in F&K... again... especially\\n     Example 13.4. \\n Inline functions, default arguments, overloaded functions: handout\\n Templates functions: F&K, 12.4 and handout\\n Classes: F&K, 11.1 - 11.3\\n Stacks: Budd, Ch 9, pp 235-8\\n Strings: F&K, 9.6, 13.1\\n Structures: F&K, 9.7-9.9\\n Files: F&K, Ch 8 (skim)\\n\\nLab Exercises\\n\\n 4/4 Lab\\n 3/28 Lab\\n 2/29 Lab\\n 2/22 Lab\\n 2/15 Lab\\n\\nCool Stuff\\n\\n Local Weather\\n Search Engines\\n \\n     An Introduction to WWW\\n \\n     Create a Unix account\\n \\n     Create a Personal WWW Homepage\\n \\n     Fun\\n\\n'}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cs.indiana.edu^classes^a201^index', 'pagename': 'A201 Homepage', 'content': 'Date: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 22:33:53 GMT\\nServer: Apache/1.0.3\\nContent-type: text/html\\nContent-length: 13127\\nLast-modified: Tue, 19 Nov 1996 05:11:40 GMT\\n\\n\\n\\nA201 Homepage\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA201/A597 -- Introduction to Programming\\nFall Semester 1996\\n\\nlast updated: 11/17/96, 12:32pm\\nContents:\\n\\n  What\\'s new\\n\\n Class Information\\n Who\\'s in charge here?\\n Class meeting times, room numbers, office\\nhours, etc.\\n Course Overview\\n Textbook and Supplies\\n Important Dates\\n The Relationship between Lecture and Lab\\n Electronic Mail\\n Programming Assignments\\n Exams\\n Tentative Weekly Schedule\\n Grading Policies and accessing the gradebook\\n Turbo C++ Keyboard Command Summary\\n A brief History of Computers\\n Miscellaneous\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTests, Practicals, and Lab Assignments\\n\\n Lab Assignments and solutions to old\\nlabs\\n Current Reading Assignments\\n Solutions to Test #1\\n Solutions to Practical #1:  Part 1\\nand Part 2\\n \\nI have made available a practice test for Test\\n#2.

The emphasis is on problem solving techniques and logical\\nexpression through programming.  We will study the C++ programming\\nlanguage using Borland\\'s Turbo C++ compiler, which is available at\\nseveral UCS Computing Sites.  No previous\\ncomputer experience is required.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTexbook and Supplies\\n\\n Textbook: Frank L. Friedman and Elliot B. Koffman, Problem Solving, Abstraction, and Design Using C++, \\nAddison-Wesley, 1994  <ISBN: 0-201-52649-2>\\n 10 or more 3.5 inch double or high density diskettes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelationship between Lecture and Lab\\nIn the lecture, we shall cover basic concepts and methods of\\nprogramming and problem solving.  We shall explore lots of examples,\\nbut we shall not go through the details of the lab assignments.  In\\nthe lab, you will work on concrete problems and learn to apply the\\nconcepts of the lecture.  You will need to attend the lectures in\\norder to be prepared for the labs.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nElectronic Mail\\n\\nYou are expected to communicate via e-mail.  Course announcements will\\nbe distributed in this manner, so you should check your mail\\noften. This will necessitate that you have a university computer\\naccount.  To obtain an account, you must take your IU photo\\nidentification card to the Indiana Memorial Union (IMU) room M084.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProgramming Assignments\\n\\nIn the lab sessions, you will work on several exercises related to the\\nmaterial that has been covered in class. You will also be given an\\nassignment to complete.  This assignment will be due at the\\nbeginning of your next lab session.  You may have time during\\nthe lab to work on your assignment.  This gives you the opportunity to\\nask questions.  Most assignments will require you to spend several\\nhours working outside of lab.  We will be using the Borland Turbo C++\\ncompiler, which is available at several UCS\\nsites.  You may also purchase your own copy of Turbo C++.  It is\\navailable at the IU Bookstore for roughly $50.00 (this is including\\nthe student discount).  Be aware that this is a newer version than\\nwhat is installed on the UCS machines- therefore there are some minor\\ninconsistencies.  All assignments must compile and run using the\\nversion of Turbo C++ on the UCS machines.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExams\\n\\nThere will be two written, closed-book exams, and two open-book lab\\npracticals (see a listing of important dates).  The final exam is\\nalso closed-book and is cumulative.  If you must miss an exam, you\\nmust see Dr. Mathias in advance.  No exceptions will be\\nmade. You must pass the final exam in order to pass this course.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrading\\n\\n\\nFinal grades will be determined according to the following:\\n\\n\\n      Exam 1 15%\\n      Exam 2 15%\\n      Final 20%\\n      Practical 1 10%\\n      Practical 2 15%\\n      Lab Assignments 25%\\n\\n\\n\\nAll grades will be kept online.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMiscellaneous\\n\\n No grades of \"incomplete\" will be given for poor performance.\\nThere will be no \"extra work\" assigned to help students improve their\\ngrades or make up missing work.\\n  If you must miss an exam or practical, you must see\\nDr. Mathias in advance.  No exceptions will be made.\\n All grades become final one week after the material is returned\\nto you.  No claims will be considered after this deadline.  All claims\\nmust be submitted in writing to your AI during office hours.\\n Cheating will not be tolerated.  You are required to read and\\n     abide by the Computer Science\\nAcademic Integrity Policy. \\n     Unless otherwise stated, you are expected to complete all work \\n     independently.\\n  If you must miss an exam or practical, you must see\\nDr. Mathias in advance.

The bulk of the concepts in the course will\\nbe presented, explained and illustrated by way of extended\\nexamples in the lectures.  The readings serve to provide more\\ndetails and depth on selected concepts.  Homework is designed\\nto develop student's abilities to apply concepts and synthesize\\nsolutions to new problems based on those concepts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLectures \\nand Readings\\nLectures and readings function\\nas an integrated presentation of the course material.  It is\\nexpected that readings will be read prior to the appropriate\\nlecture.  \\n\\n\\nHomework \\nThere will be four homework assignments.  The\\nassignments will involve applying and extending the concepts\\npresented in the lectures and readings.  For some of the homeworks\\nyou will be required to apply specific techniques to actual\\ncode.  For these assignments I will make samples\\nof code available that you can use; alternatively you can\\nuse a piece of code that you have developed.\\n\\nHomeworks should be completed individually.  Do not work with any\\nother person.  Assignments are due at the beginning of class\\n10%will be deducted for late assignments (an additional 10%\\nfor each day late).  Off-campus students may either\\nemail their solutions to me or fax\\ntheir solutions using (913)532-7353.\\n\\n\\n\\nExaminations \\nThere will be a comprehensive take-home final exam.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinal grades will be assigned based on the following weighting:\\nhomeworks (40%), mid-term (20%), and final (40%).  \\n\\n\\n\\nREADINGS\\n\\nThe required readings for this course are selected papers from the literature.\\n\\n\\n References\\n\\n\\nIf you do not have access to these papers, they have been collected\\nand are available from Copy Co., phone number (913) 537-2679.  The\\ncost is ~$50.\\n\\nIn addition to the required readings you may find the following\\ntexts useful as they contain some of the material in the course.\\nThey range from general software engineering texts to in-depth\\ntreatments of issues related to particular verification and \\nvalidation approaches.\\n\\nThere are a number of general software engineering\\ntext.  This text does a good job with software quaility issues: Fundamentals of software engineering,\\n       C. Ghezzi, M. Jazayeri and D. Mandrioli,\\n       Prentice-Hall\\n\\n\\nThe following two texts cover a broad range of \\ntesting techniques and contain significant practical\\ninformation for testers. Software Testing Techniques,\\n       B. Beizer,\\n       Van Nostrand Reinhold,\\n\\n\\n The Craft of Software Testing,\\n       B. Marick,\\n       Prentice-Hall\\n\\n\\nRepresentations and algorithms for data flow analysis are\\ncovered in most compiler books.  A good example is:\\n Compilers : Principles, Techniques, and Tools,\\n       A.V. Aho, R. Sethi and J.D. Ullman,\\n       Addison-Wesley\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES\\n\\nWeb pages for course (linked off of\\nmy home page) will \\ninclude assignments, solutions, lecture notes, and links\\nto other validation and verification pages.\\n\\n\\nORGANIZATION & SCHEDULE\\n\\nThe course is broken up into the following parts:\\nfoundations\\nof program analysis.  \\nWe cover mathematical preliminaries.   How validation\\nand verification activities relate to other software\\ndevelopment activities. \\nWe present and discuss a variety of models that are\\nused to represent\\nand reason about the possible behavior of a program.\\n\\nspecification\\nof intended program behavior.  How do\\nwe say what a program should do?\\n\\nWhile there are a variety of different specification formalisms,\\nin this course, we will focus on finite state automata specifications.\\n\\n\\nstatic techniques\\nexamine the text of designs, specifications or code.\\nOne can view static techniques as a kind of abstract execution\\nof the program.  This execution produces different kinds of output\\nthan the normal program execution and that output is used to\\ndrive validation and  verification efforts.  This execution\\ncan be accomplished on a variety of different substrates.\\nWe will study both:\\nmanual\\ntechniques that use developers to perform program analyses.\\n  automated\\ntechniques that algorithmically perform program analyses.\\n\\n\\n\\ndynamic techniques\\ninvolve executing an implementation with\\nrespect to the semantics of the language in which it is written.\\nValidation and verification efforts are based on observing the\\nbehaviour of the software as it executes.  This can include\\nobserving normal program output as well as probing the state\\nof the software during different points in its execution.\\nWell look at techniques based on both of these:\\nassertion based\\nanalyses involve periodic checking of intended behavior during program execution.\\n  testing\\ninvolves checking of software input/output relationships.\\n\\n\\n\\nsoftware processes\\nthat support verification and validation\\nprovide an infrastructure in which quality assurance activities can\\nbe organized, monitored, and controlled.\\n\\nsoftware safety\\nin life-critical systems is emerging as an increasingly\\nimportant area of quality  assurance.\\n\\nconcurrency\\nis being used increasingly in distributed and parallel\\nsoftware.  Along with increased performance comes an increase in the\\ncomplexity of the already difficult\\nproblem of quality assurance.  We will consider the impact of concurrency\\non both static and dynamic analysis approaches.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndwyer@cis.ksu.edu\\n\\n\"}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cis.ksu.edu^~howell^775cur^index', 'pagename': 'CIS 775', 'content': \"Date: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 22:38:38 GMT\\nServer: NCSA/1.5.1\\nLast-modified: Fri, 18 Oct 1996 19:34:24 GMT\\nContent-type: text/html\\nContent-length: 910\\n\\nCIS 775\\nCourse materials for CIS 775, Fall '96\\n\\n Syllabus -\\n\\n\\n Hypertext\\n Postscript\\n\\n Homework 1, due 11:00 a.m., Sept. 17\\n   \\n Hypertext\\n Postscript\\n\\n Homework 2, due 11:00 a.m., Oct. 8 - #4 corrected 10/7\\n   \\n Hypertext\\n Postscript\\n\\n Exam1, due 11:00 a.m., Oct. 24 - #1 corrected as stated in class, 10/15\\n   \\n Hypertext\\n Postscript\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRod Howell\\n(howell@cis.ksu.edu)\\n\\n\"}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cis.ksu.edu^~dimitris^761fall96', 'pagename': 'N/A', 'content': 'Date: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 22:38:46 GMT\\nServer: NCSA/1.5.1\\nLast-modified: Wed, 13 Nov 1996 19:35:10 GMT\\nContent-type: text/html\\nContent-length: 830\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCIS 761 \\n\\n   Database Management Systems\\n\\nThe following information is available\\n\\n \\nCourse Information\\n\\nCourse Material\\n \\nAssignments\\n \\nExams\\n \\nProject \\n  Oracle  DBMS\\n     PL/SQL \\n  C Compilation  Info \\n   \\n\\n Contact Info:\\n dimitris@cis.ksu.edu\\n\\n'}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cis.ksu.edu^~dag^740fall95^cs740', 'pagename': 'CIS740 Home Page', 'content': 'Date: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 22:38:49 GMT\\nServer: NCSA/1.5.1\\nLast-modified: Fri, 22 Sep 1995 20:51:45 GMT\\nContent-type: text/html\\nContent-length: 972\\n\\n\\n\\nCIS740 Home Page\\n\\n\\nCIS740 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING\\nDr. David A.

We study the theoretical foundations\\nof translators and common implementation techniques.  The course will\\nfocus on compilers for high-level languages, but we will also look\\nat applying translation techniques to a variety of little languages.\\n\\n\\n\\nLECTURES\\nNichols 127, MWF 10:30-11:20 am\\n\\n\\n\\nINSTRUCTOR\\nProf. Matt Dwyer\\n \\nOffice:       Nichols 324E\\nEmail:        dwyer@cis.ksu.edu\\nWWW:          http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~dwyer\\nPhone:        532-6350\\nOffice Hours: MW 2:30-3:30, Thu 2:00-3:00\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTEXT\\nCompilers : Principles, Techniques, and Tools, Aho, Sethi, and Ullman, Addison-Wesley\\n\\n\\n\\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES\\nWeb pages for course will \\ninclude tool documentation,\\nassignments, solutions, test cases, and\\n\\nlecture notes\\n\\n\\n\\nPREREQUISITES\\nCIS 500\\n\\n\\n\\nREQUIREMENTS\\nThe course will consist of a mixture of different kinds of\\nassignments.  A major component of your grade will be determined by\\na large multi-part compiler implementation \\n\\nproject.  There will\\nbe an open-book open-note in-class \\n\\nfinal exam.\\nOccasional short \\n\\nhomework assignments and closed-book closed-note in-class \\n\\nquizzes will be given.   The goal of\\nthese assignments is to provide feedback to you on how you are\\nprogressing in understanding the course material.  It also provides\\nvaluable feedback to me on how you are doing so that I can tailor\\nthe course to maximize the benefit to the class.\\nThe weighting used for the final grade will be : 50%project,\\n30%final exam and 20%homeworks and quizes.\\n\\nThe project consists of implementing a compiler for a \\nPascal-like language with classes.\\nYou may write your compiler in C, C++, Pascal or Ada (if you really want\\nto write it in another language come and talk to me).  \\nI expect the code to be clearly organized and documented\\n(I am very serious about this).  \\nIf you use either C, C++ or Ada you can write your lexical analyzer using\\na scanner generator, such as \\nflex (see \"man flexdoc\" for details).\\nIf you use another\\nlanguage you will have to build the lexical analyzer by hand.\\nRegardless of the implementation language you will build a top-down\\nrecursive descent parser.  This parser will produce an abstract\\nsyntax tree intermediate representation from which code will be generated.\\nYou may use the\\nVCG\\ntool to quickly and easily produce postscript depictions of your syntax trees.\\nYour compiler will generate assembly code for the MIPS R2000/R3000.  \\nGenerated programs will be executed on a MIPS simulator called \\n\\nspim.\\nIf you don\\'t already know about machine architecture and assembly language\\nprogramming you might start to browse the spim document.\\n\\nThe compiler will be implemented in four phase:\\n Scanner with identifier table\\n Parser with type checking\\n Embellish Parser to build IR \\n Optimize IR\\n Code Generator\\n\\n\\nThe project can be implemented either independently or in pairs.  \\nThose who chose to work in pairs will be expected to perform some\\nlocal optimization of the generated code.  This will involve building\\nan additional phase to perform the IR optimization.\\n\\nIn part,\\t\\nthis is an exercise in building a large software system with reasonably\\ncomplicated component interactions.   You will not be graded on the quality\\nof the generated code.  Correctness of the code, however, is very important.\\nI will make a number of test files available prior to the due date of\\neach stage.  You are encouraged to use these to test your implementation.\\nI may execute your projects on those (and other) test files.\\nYou may also create tests of your own.  If there is sufficient interest\\nwe can create a class wide collection of test cases for all to use.\\n\\nAll students are encouraged to talk to each other about\\ncompiler concepts, design alternatives, implementation details, etc. \\nThe final product should be of your own creation.  If you copy other\\'s\\nwork you will not be prepared for the exam and you will not maximize\\nthe benefit you get from this course.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCHEDULE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACADEMIC HONESTY\\n\\n\\nOn all assignments, you are expected to do your own work. \\nFrom the Provost\\'s office: \"Plagiarism and cheating are serious offenses \\nand may be punished by failure on the exam, paper or project, failure in \\nthe course and/or expulsion from the University.

The course begins with a\\nthorough review of Object Oriented Programming and C++.  The core Data\\nStructures are then introduced including: Pointers, Arrays, Stacks,\\nLinked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, and Queues.  These Data\\nStructures are then applied to problems like Dictionaries, Discrete\\nEvent Simulation, Shortest Paths, and Topological Sorting.  Using\\nthe Data Structures as a base, students then investigate some of the\\nfundamental Algorithms of Computer Science.  These include: Sorting,\\nBalanced Trees, Graphs, NP-hard problems, Splay Trees, and Memory\\nManagement.  In addition to course lectures and exams, students will\\nalso be responsible for four significant programming projects.\\n\\nTextbook\\n\\nAlgorithms, Data Structures, and Problem Solving with C++, by Mark\\nAllen Weiss, Addison-Wesley Publishing, ISBN 0-8053-1666-3, hardcover,\\n820 pages, 1996.\\nCourse Sections\\nSection 1\\nCourse Time/Location\\n\\nCourse Time: MW 4-5:20 PM \\nLocation: Sage 3101\\n\\nInstructor: Alok Mehta \\n\\nE-Mail: mehtaa@cs.rpi.edu\\nOffice Hours: MW 5:30-6:30 PM\\nOffice Location: Amos Eaton 218\\n(Home) Phone:  518-785-7576 (best time to call: \\nevenings, until 10:00 pm)\\n\\n\\nTeaching Assistant: Patrick Fry \\n\\nE-Mail: fryp@cs.rpi.edu\\nOffice Hours: M 10-11:30AM, Th 12-1:30 PM\\nOffice Location: Amos Eaton 211\\nOffice Phone: x 2816\\n\\n Section 2\\nCourse Time/Location\\n\\nCourse Time: MW 9:00-10:20 AM \\nLocation: Sage 3101\\n\\nInstructor: Bob Dugan\\n\\nE-Mail: dugan@rpi.edu\\nOffice Hours: MW 10:30-11:30 AM\\nOffice Location: Amos Eaton 211\\nOffice Phone:  518-276-2816\\nOther Ways of finding Bob\\n\\nTeaching Assistant: David Goldschmidt\\n\\nE-Mail: goldsd@cs.rpi.edu\\nOffice Hours: Tue 5:30-8:30 PM\\nOffice Location: Sage 1112\\nOffice Phone: 518-276-4849 (during office hours only)\\nOther Ways of finding Dave\\n\\nAccessing Course Information Electronically\\n\\nIn order to complete the projects for this course, you will need an\\nRCS account.

Useful forms of collaboration include discussing design\\nalternatives, details of algorithms and data structures, possible\\nsources of reusable code, and help with debugging, compiling,\\nmakefiles, etc.\\n\\nYou are also encouraged to practice code reuse, with the stipulation\\nthat any reused code submitted as part of your assignment must be\\nclearly and explicitly attributed.  Code that can be reused includes\\nthat found in the textbooks, code from previous work you have done (in\\nthis class or others), and code from other books or Internet sites.\\n\\nYou may NOT reuse code written by another student in the class.  \\n\\nThe easiest way to attribute any code that you reuse is with a\\ncomment.  You must give enough information so that the TAs can find\\nthe code themselves.  Examples:\\n\\n  /* the following code is from p.111 of Weiss textbook */\\n  class vector { ...\\n\\n  /* the following code is from my CS I project, Feb 1995. */\\n\\n  /* the following code was downloaded from ftp://ftp.cs.rpi.edu/pub/... */\\n\\n  /* the following code is from the book \"Advanced C++\" by James Coplien,\\n   * Addison-Wesley, 1992, p.152\\n   */\\n\\n\\nCollaboration and discussion does not mean that the assignments may be\\ndone jointly; each assignment you submit must be 100 percent your own\\nwork.  You must be especially carefull when discussing another\\nstudent\\'s code (perhaps to help with finding a bug).  DO NOT copy any\\nof the code, either on paper or electronically.  DO NOT write any code\\nfor the other student, even just to fix a typographical error.  DO NOT\\nlook and another student\\'s code and then sit down and write nearly\\nidentical (but not quite) code yourself.  DO NOT \"paraphrase\" code\\nfrom another source and fail to attribute it in a comment.\\n\\nAny code submitted which the TAs find too similar to another students\\ncode, or any code which is similar to code from a book or another\\nsource which has not been properly attributed, will result in a zero\\nfor the assignment in question and possibly a failing course grade.\\nPolicy on Late Work\\n\\nHomeworks are due at 11:59:59 PM, on the due date.  Late homeworks will \\nbe accepted with a penalty of 10% per day for 3 days.  After that, the\\nproject will not be accepted.\\n\\nExams are to be taken at the specified date and time.  If you miss the\\nexam, you will receive a 0.\\n\\nSometimes things happen. If there are circumstances that prevent you\\nfrom meeting your obligations for this course, you need to talk to us\\nor the TAs to make arrangements IN ADVANCE.\\nDropping the Course\\n\\nWe want you to stay in the course!  Please talk to us before you \\ndecide to drop.  If things can\\'t work out, the drop\\ndate is September 30, 1996\\n\\n\\n\\nBob Dugan dugan@rpi.edu  \\nAlok Mehta  mehtaa@cs.rpi.edu \\n\\n\\n'}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cs.rpi.edu^courses^sysprog^index', 'pagename': 'Systems Programming Home Page', 'content': \"Date: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 22:48:47 GMT\\nServer: Apache/1.1.1\\nContent-type: text/html\\nContent-length: 9945\\nLast-modified: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 19:48:35 GMT\\n\\n\\n\\nSystems Programming Home Page\\n\\n\\nSystems Programming Home Page\\n66-431 Fall, 1996\\n\\n\\nLast updated November 20, 1996\\n\\n The optional final exam for this course is scheduled for\\nMonday Afternoon, Dec. 16. at 2:00 PM.

However, there will be an optional\\ncomprehensive final exam which can be used to replace a missing test or\\nproject or your lowest test or project.\\n\\nAcademic Integrity: All programs submitted must be your own work,\\nand you are expected to develop your programs independently.  You may\\nreceive as much help as you wish on the use of the operating system,\\ntext editors, debuggers, file transfer protocols and so on.  You may\\nconsult with other members of the class about interpreting the\\nassignment, and you may get help in finding bugs, but not fixing bugs,\\nbut you are not allowed to look at or copy another person's code or\\ndiscuss design decisions with others, and you cannot show your code to\\nothers.  Students found to be in violation of these guidelines will\\nfail the project, and will be reported to the dean.\\n\\nProgramming assignments: This is a programming intensive course,\\nand students are expected to be strong C programmers.  Assignments may\\nbe done in either C or C++.  While you may use whatever platforms or\\ncompilers you wish to develop your code, all code submitted must run\\non both Sun and AIX platforms on RCS and must compile without errors\\nor significant warnings using gcc -Wall .... Assignments will\\nbe submitted by e-mailing source code to the TA (multiple files should\\nbe bundled using  shar).  You must submit a make file with each\\nassignment.  There will be ten point per day penalty for lateness.\\n\\nSchedule\\nThis schedule is tentative and should not be taken too literally.\\nI will sometimes be ahead of this, sometimes \\nbehind it, and sometimes completely off of it.\\n\\nSchedule of Topics\\n\\nDate\\nTopics\\nReading\\n\\n\\nTu Aug 27\\nUnix standards, Posix, debugging, shar\\nStevens Ch 1,2\\n\\n\\nTh Aug 29\\nStructure of a C program, compiling, linking,\\nmake, libraries, concept of a system call, errno\\n\\nStevens, Ch. 7\\n\\n\\nTu Sep 3\\nI/O, Files, file system calls\\nStevens, Ch 3\\n\\n\\nTh Sep 5\\nFiles and directories, more system calls\\nStevens, Ch 4,5,6\\n\\n\\nTu Sep 10\\nProcess concepts fork, exec, etc.\\nStevens, Ch 8\\n\\n\\nTh Sep 12\\nprocess group relations, daemon processes\\nStevens, Ch 9\\n\\n\\nTu Sep 17\\nSignals\\nStevens, Ch 10\\n\\n\\nTh Sep 19\\nInterprocess Communication, Pipes, FIFOs\\nStevens, Ch 14\\n\\n\\nTu Sep 24\\nConcurrency Concepts\\nnone\\n\\n\\nTh Sep 26\\nConcurrency in Unix, semaphores, file locks, shared memory\\nStevens, Ch 14\\n\\nTu Oct 1\\nExamples, a postscript printer, a database library\\nStevens Ch 16, 17\\n\\n\\nTh Oct 3\\nThe Client Server model, sockets\\nOnline reading\\n\\n\\nTu Oct 8\\nMore on sockets, the Internet, review\\nnone   \\n\\n\\nTh Oct 10\\nExam\\n none  \\n\\n\\nTh Oct 17\\n Design of Clients and Servers\\n \\n\\n\\nTu Oct 22\\nIntro. to networking, protocol stacks\\n \\n\\n\\nTh Oct 24\\nThe Internet, IP\\n \\n\\n\\nTu Oct 29\\nTCP and UDP\\n \\n\\n\\nTh Oct 31\\nSecurity, Kerberos\\n \\n\\n\\nTu Nov 5\\nOverview of the X window system\\nYoung, Ch 1,2,3\\n\\n\\nTh Nov 7\\nPrimitive Motif Widgets\\nYoung, Ch 4\\n\\n\\nTu Nov 12\\nManager Widgets\\nYoung, Ch 5\\n\\n\\nTh Nov 14\\nMenus and dialogs\\nYoung Ch 6,7\\n\\n\\nTu Nov 19\\nEvents\\nYoung, Ch 8\\n\\n\\nTh Nov 21\\nGraphics, color, fonts, bitmaps\\nYoung, Ch 9-13\\n\\n\\nTu Nov 26\\nCreating your own widgets\\nYoung Ch 14, 15\\n\\n\\nTu Dec 3\\nReview\\n \\n\\n\\nTh Dec 5\\nExam\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProjects\\nGeneral Project Guidelines  All projects should follow\\nguidelines for good programming practices.

However,\\nyou should use comments to describe any unusual code or hard to follow\\ncode or complicated code, and describe any non-obvious variables.\\n variables and functions should have meaningful names, but you can\\nuse single letters like i for loop counters and such.\\n You should check the return code for any system call that can\\nfail and have an appropriate error handler.\\n Your code should have enough error checking so that no matter\\nwhat the user does, your program will not seg fault or loop forever,\\nor do other strange things.  It is very hard to\\nmake your program idiot proof; idiots are very clever.\\n All code must be written by you and you alone, except that you\\ncan use and modify any sample code from the text or from class as long\\nas you provide credit to the source.\\n\\n\\n\\n About Project 1 \\n About Project 2 \\n About Project 3 \\n About Project 4 \\n About Project 5 \\n About Project 6 \\n\\n\\n\\nIf you have problems or suggestions - send mail to \\nsysprog@cs.rpi.edu.\\n\\nMiscellaneous Resources\\n\\nAt the request of one of the students, here is a link to \\na list of all of the \\nRFCs (Request for Comments).

The cognitive sciences have developed a base of knowledge about people in general, and a good deal of it is actually useful in interface design!  Also, the common suggestion \"well, go study some people\" can be performed better with more trustworthy results if you have knowledge of testing techniques.\\n\\n\\nThis course introduces a practical side of the cognitive sciences, oriented to designers.  Focused readings and homework assignments will cover useful highlights of the theory and high \"bang for the buck\" methodologies.  Students will see cases of when and how different areas of cognitive theory may and may not be useful to design.  Additionally, students will learn about and try different testing methodologies.\\n\\n\\n\\nMajor topics surveyed this quarter will include high level cognition/perception (e.g., reasoning, affordances, gestalt psychology); low level cognition/perception (e.g., attention, color vision, sound); applied methodologies (e.g., \"the experiment,\" effective interviewing, the case study, and other methods); design and human error; a designer\\'s view of human memory; and application issues.\\n\\n\\nCS-246 is targeted for designers.  A background in cognition and perception is not expected.  Course topics are likely to have little overlap with those in psychology classes and the perspective will be different where there is overlap.\\n\\nThe course will be oriented around weekly readings, and regular homework assignments which exercise skills that support design and analysis.  The midterm is likely to be a take-home on the scale of a big homework.  There will probably not be a final exam, although the quarter\\'s last homework assignment will tie together the course.\\n\\n\\n\\nClick here for the 94-95 reading list\\n\\nClick here for list of HCI courses at Stanford\\n\\nInformation provided for the Stanford Computer Science Department by the HCI Course Coordinator as part of the description of HCI at Stanford.

Programming labs  \\nensure students acquire strong programming and design skills.  Topics  \\ncovered include object-oriented architecture, elements of user interface  \\ndesign, testing strategies, project management.\\n\\nHandout #1 1993-94 excerpt:\\n\\nWelcome to CS193e: Object-Oriented User Interface Programming on the  \\nNeXT machine.  In your typical CS class, you focus your efforts on the  \\nalgorithmic side of problem solving. This class deals with a different  \\ntype of program complexity: building programs to interact with users.   \\nThe user takes charge and the program must appropriately present the  \\napplication functionality, handle user actions, and provide feedback on  \\nthose events.  The Xerox Star, the Apple Macintosh, the varied graphic  \\ninterfaces of Sun workstations are all examples of environments where  \\napplications must support this user-driven model.\\n\\n\\nThe user has greatly benefitted from the shift in application design,  \\nbut unfortunately, the programmer often pays the price for this  \\nease-of-use, investing months of engineering time dealing with the  \\nmyriad facets of the user interface.  Given that programmers don't enjoy  \\npain and re-inventing the wheel, the environments for application design  \\nhave been evolving to provide better support for application  \\ndevelopment.  Large toolkits exist for the Mac, Windows, X, etc. that  \\nassist in presenting a consistent interface and interaction with user.  \\n\\n\\nAnother trend is the move towards object-oriented programming.   \\nObject-oriented programming has some advantages over the traditional  \\nprocedure programming mode.  First, it increases the modularity of  \\nprograms and the likelihood that modules can be reused in other programs  \\nwithout being rewritten from scratch.  Second, object-oriented  \\nprogramming is a natural framework in which to program graphical user  \\ninterfaces; graphics elements such as windows and menus are naturally  \\nmodelled as objects, while clicking with the mouse can be viewed simply  \\nas sending a message to the object under the cursor at the time of the  \\nclick.  \\n\\n\\nThe object-oriented system bundled with the NeXT machine, NeXTstep,  \\nrepresents the one of the most cohesive object-oriented UI toolkits and  \\nappears to the benchmark to which other systems are compared.  For this  \\nreason, you will be learning and using the NeXT to explore the world of  \\nbuilding UI applications.

The topics we will cover are in no way exhaustive, and of course, they reflect my own subjective biases. I will be using Tanenbaum's textbook as well as a short collection of papers. This combination should help expose you to both some practical and well as theoretical aspect of distributed systems. I expect you all to read the chapters and papers that I discuss in class. I strongly encourage you to come and talk to me about any distributed systems topics that are not covered in this list. I expect to hand out 5-6 homework assignments. Some of these will involve programming some of the basic ideas discussed in class. Some of the homeworks may involve reading a paper that is related to the topic being discussed in class. I have put several books on reserve in the library, some of which may provide some background material, while others complement the class.\\n\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\n Textbook and Notes \\n\\n  \\n\\t\\t  Distributed Operating Systems, Andrew S.

The purpose of the functions\\nis to give examples on how to acceess the data.  However the data\\nin the nodes should be left untouched.\\n\\n\\nIn the project handout (page 6) I say that x is followed by a CR.\\nI should have said that x is followed by a CR or a blank.\\nThe same holds for string y. \\nA little C++ program to read data is in file ~cs130a/files/read.C\\n\\n\\n***************************\\nOctober 18, 1996   7:00 pm\\n***************************\\n\\n\\nIn the project I say that when a ArrayTrieNode or a LinkedTrieNode\\nhas a count that becomes 1 it should become a TinyTrieNode.\\nThat is INCORRECT (sorry about that).

You can copy them into your directory,\\ncompile it and run it.\\n\\n\\n***************************\\nOctober 28, 1996   10:30 am\\n***************************\\n \\n\\nAs we say in the project description we are dealing with sets, so\\nwe do not keep multiple copies of the same word in the same set.\\nAlso, the input is ERROR FREE. But one might try to insert\\na word in a set that is already there or delete a word that\\nis not in a set.  In the first case you must not insert the word and\\nthe count needs to remain unchanged.  In the second case, the count must\\nremain unchanged and nothing must be deleted.  Note that this is important\\nto facilitate testing.\\n\\n\\nIf you implement insert as in the class\\nnotes, you will have to make to passes\\nover the Trie in some cases. Either to \\nupdate the count when inserting a new word, or\\n\"unupdating\" the count if it was updated incorrectly\\nbecause the word was already there.\\n \\n\\nYou can create a member function whoami (defined like\\nGetNext) to return the type of object you have for derived\\nclasses (like TinyTrieNode, etc.).\\n \\n\\n\\n***************************\\nOctober 28, 1996   15:30 pm\\n***************************\\n \\n\\nRemember that the final type of a node DEPENDS on the\\nNUMBER OF WORDS in that subtree  It DOES NOT depend on the number of nodes\\nor the number of nonnull pointers in that subtree.\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n***************************\\nOctober 31, 1996   15:15 pm\\n***************************\\n \\n\\nThe Office hours of the TAs on Wednesday and Friday will be in CSIL\\nfrom now till December.\\n\\n\\nIf you would like CSIL to be open during the Thankgiving Holidays,\\nplease send e-mail to humphrey@cs.

It is a unique paradigm suitable \\nfor many non-numeric applications, \\nand has connections with a variety of areas of computer science including \\nautomatic theorem proving, deductive database, and various AI applications \\nsuch as natural language processing, expert systems, and knowledge \\nrepresentation.  The principal focus \\nof this course will be on the semantics and pragmatics of Prolog programming, \\nand its aptness for logic programming.\\n\\nGeneral background from the formal prerequisites 22C:21 and 22C:23 will be \\nassumed.  There will be no prior knowledge of logic programming required, \\nnecessary background for course topics will be developed.  It will be assumed \\nthat the student has experience \\nwith several programming languages, and especially that recursion is a familiar \\nconcept.  Please note that undergraduate majors can select this course as one \\nof the two advanced CS courses required for the B.S. degree.  \\n\\nThe course will involve both conceptual and project work.  The projects \\nwill be of \\nmodest size and will use Prolog and possibly other logic languages for which \\nimplementations can be obtained.  A tentative listing below indicates the \\nrange of topics.  \\nIt will not be possible to provide a complete treatment of all these topics, \\nso some will be touched on only briefly.\\n\\n Tenative topic list \\n\\n Overview of Prolog and the philosophy of logic programming\\n\\n Substitutions & unification\\n\\n Horn clause logic\\n\\n proof theory - resolution\\n model theory semantics\\n computability\\n\\n\\n Prolog semantics\\n\\n procedural semantics\\n WAM(Warren\\'s Abstract Machine) code\\n\\n\\nLogic programming vs. Prolog programming\\n\\n arithmetic & \\'is\\'\\n occur-check\\n cut\\n assert/retract\\n higher-order features(e.g., call, findall)\\n negation, CWA, & NAF\\n difference lists\\n\\n\\n Logic grammars\\n\\n translation to Prolog clauses\\n programming language and natural language analysis\\n\\n\\n Unifying functional & logic programming\\n\\n equational logic\\n rewriting systems\\n narrowing\\n\\n\\n For further Web information on logic programming see the \\n \\nWWW logic programming page.\\n\\n\\n'}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cs.uiowa.edu^~oden^courses^cs5', 'pagename': '22c:5 Problem Solving & Computing', 'content': \"Date: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 23:18:12 GMT\\nServer: NCSA/1.5\\nContent-type: text/html\\n\\n\\n\\n22c:5 Problem Solving & Computing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n22c:5  Problem Solving and Computing\\nMWF 10:30 in the Information Arcade, Memorial Library\\n\\n\\nThe instructor\\n\\nGregg Od&eacuten\\n\\n[E221 SSH, 335-2444; also 101c MLH]\\noden@cs.uiowa.edu\\nwith the assistance of Nicolae Duta \\nduta@cs.uiowa.edu\\n\\n\\nThe course\\nProblem solving is a pervasive human activity but some people are better at it \\nthan others.

The techniques that have evolved within computer science \\nare general ones that apply to non-computer problem solving as well.\\nIn this class, we will examine these techniques as they apply to \\nproblems in general and in the context of being able to make computers do \\nwhat you want them to do. Students will get extensive experience in \\nperforming exercises on the computer both in and out of class. \\nThese exercises will be done in a strongly supportive computing environment; \\nno prior experience with computers is presupposed.\\n\\n\\nThe assignments\\nThere will be two midterms exams each covering one section of the course as \\nshown on the schedule (over) and a final exam covering the third section plus \\nthe course as a whole. In addition, there will be homework assignments every \\nweek or so for the first half of the course and some sort of course \\nproject during the latter half. Exams 1 and 2 will count 10% and 20% toward \\nthe course grade respectively, the homework will count 20%, and the project \\nand final exam will each be 25%.\\n\\n\\nCourse grades will be determined on the basis of the resulting final \\ndistribution of numerical scores.  My current expectation is that about a \\nsixth of the class will get A grades (that is, A+, A or A-), about a \\nthird will get B grades, and another third will get C grades. However, I \\nreserve the right to adjust these proportions to better reflect overall \\nclass performance. For example, if it turns out that this class does \\nsomewhat better than expected, then there will be more good grades; \\nif it does worse, then there will fewer good grades. I will periodically \\nprovide updated information about the expected distribution of grades as we \\ngo along through the semester so you will know pretty much where you stand.\\n\\n\\nThe texts\\n\\n\\nHow to Solve Mathematical Problems  by Wickelgren.

There will be some small\\nprogramming assignments.  Programming problems will usually be given\\nas part of regular written homework assignments; there will not be a\\nseparate grading category for programming assignments.  Class\\nparticipation and effort may be taken into account in determining grades in\\nborderline situations.  The components will be weighted roughly as\\nfollows:\\n\\n\\t\\tHomeworks assignments         35%\\n\\t\\tMidterm exams                 20% each\\n\\t\\tFinal exam                    25%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Late assignment policy\\n\\n\\nAll assignments are due at the beginning of class.  In other cases,\\nassignments turned in within 24 hours will receive a 20% penalty, and\\nthose turned in 24 to 48 hours late will receive a 50% penalty.\\n(Exception --- each student may turn in one homework assignment up to\\ntwo days late with no penalty.)  Regrade requests must be made within\\none week of when the assignments are returned in class.\\n\\n\\n\\n Policy on collaboration\\n\\n\\nHomework and programming assignments should be done alone.  It is \\nreasonable to discuss general approaches to problem solution or \\nalgorithm design with other students but the bulk of the work \\nmust be done alone.  Working out details, sharing in the write-up \\nor sharing or copying code will be treated as a violation of the \\nacademic integrity rules.\\n\\n\\n  Note on Language for Progamming Assignments \\n\\nProgram source code in the book is in Pascal.  However, for course \\nprogramming assignments, you will be free to use your choice of Pascal, C, or \\nC++ (or another language if approved by the instructor).\\n\\n\\n\\n Homework Assignments\\n\\n\\n\\n Homework 8 (HTML version).\\nHomework 8 (Postscript version).\\n Official test data for Homework 8 (must turn in \\nruns of your program on these files):\\nwordlist1,\\nwordlist2,\\nwordlist3\\n\\nSome other test data for Homework 8:\\nextra-wordlist1,\\nextra-wordlist2,\\nextra-wordlist3\\n Homework 7 (HTML version).\\nHomework 7 (Postscript version).\\n Homework 6 (HTML version).\\nHomework 6 (Postscript version).\\n Official test data for Homework 6 (must turn in \\nruns of your program on these files):\\ncircuit1,\\ncircuit2,\\ncircuit3, \\ncircuit4 \\npath1,\\npath2,\\npath3\\n\\nSome other test data for Homework 6:\\ntestdata11,\\ntestdata2,\\ntestdata3 \\ntestdata4,\\ntestdata5,\\ntestdata6\\n Homework 5 (HTML version).\\nHomework 5 (Postscript version).\\n Homework 4 (HTML version).\\nHomework 4 (Postscript version).\\n Homework 3 (HTML version).\\nHomework 3 (Postscript version).\\n Homework 2 (HTML version).\\nHomework 2 (Postscript version).\\n Homework 1 (Postscript file).\\nFor those who can\\'t view or print Postscript, here\\'s\\nan HTML (the basic WWW language) version \\nHomework 1. \\n\\n\\n\\n Scores and grades\\n\\n\\n\\n Course grades: \\n\\n      Total score:\\n          > 460                    A+\\n      415 - 459                    A\\n      400 - 414                    A-\\n      390 - 399                    B+\\n      385 - 389                    B\\n      370 - 379                    B-\\n      350 - 369                    C+\\n      320 - 349                    C\\n      270 - 319                    C-\\n      250 - 269                    D\\n          < 250                    F\\n\\nNOTE: the two highest scorers were graduate students.

Open this function, find the file you had \\npreviously saved, and open it.\\n\\n [4 Sep] Reading guide updated.\\n [3 Sep] Additional lecture notes for 5 and 12 Sep posted.\\n [3 Sep] Postscript Viewers no guarantee for the   \\nfollowing pointers!  I gathered some files from archives on\\nthe Internet, but I have not tried these myself.  Notice that\\nthese are rather large files, so don\\'t try to download via \\nmodem (perhaps in an ITC you can download them).\\n\\n For a PC, the following combination of files gives\\nyou ghostscript and ghostview (ghostscript is necessary\\nfor ghostview):\\n\\n  gs260fnt.zip (1760k) \\n  gs261exe.zip (1192k) \\n  gs26wi3b.zip (58k) \\n  gsview10.zip (175k) \\n\\n For Win95, the following viewer claims to display\\nusing TrueType, but I\\'m not sure it would handle the \\nfigures and equations in the lecture notes:\\n\\n  rops3244.zip (382k) \\n\\n For Macs, we have:\\n\\n  macgs-v1.0-68k.sit.hqx (2961k)  \\n--- use this one for 680x0 Macs or Power PC Macs. \\n  macgs-v1.0-ppc.sit.hqx (2983k) \\n--- this one is for Power PC Macs only.\\n\\n\\n [29 Aug] HOW TO SAVE a postscript file and bypass\\nghostview under Netscape:  instead of pressing the left\\nbutton on the link, press the right button on your mouse ---\\nthat will give you an option to \"Save Link As...\"\\nThen save the file in source format;\\nafter you save it, maybe you can use some other tool\\nto print or view it.\\n [28 Aug] Reading for Chapter 1.\\n [28 Aug] First homework posted, due 5 September.\\n\\n\\n\\n Ted Herman \\nThu 14 Nov 1996 \\n\\n\\n'}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cs.uiowa.edu^~mfleck^c19-html^top-page', 'pagename': '22c19 Course Page', 'content': 'Date: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 23:19:02 GMT\\nServer: NCSA/1.5\\nContent-type: text/html\\n\\n\\n22c19 Course Page \\n\\n22c19 (Fall 1996) Discrete Structures \\n\\nCourse Home Page \\n\\nThis is the home page of 22c19, \"Discrete Structures\", Fall 1996,\\ntaught at the  University of Iowa\\n Computer Science Department.\\n\\n\\n The Cast \\n\\nThe staff for this course are\\n Margaret Fleck \\n(mfleck@cs.uiowa.edu)\\nand Ioana Lungeanu (ioana@cs.uiowa.edu).

These will be studied and used throughout the\\ncourse as tools for the specification and verification of properties of\\nprograms and protocols.  \\nTopics: \\n\\nFirst-Order Logic: propositional logic, predicate logic,\\ncompleteness and compactness theorems, semantics via quantifier games,\\nGödel\\'s incompleteness theorem.\\n\\nModal logic: temporal logic and logics of knowledge, axiomitization,\\nsemantics via Kripke structures.\\n\\nApplications: (These may change slightly according to the background and\\ninterests of the students.)\\n\\n Evolving Algebras: due to Gurevich et. al., this offers an operatonal\\nsemantics for programming languages and protocols via finite logical\\nstructures.\\n\\nTemporal Logic of Actions: Lamport\\'s system of specification and\\nverification via temporal logic\\n\\n Distributed Protocols: we will use logics of knowledge to express\\ncorrectness and security of distributed protocols.\\n\\n Model Checking: using temporal logic to verify properties of systems\\n\\n Symbolic Model Checking: using ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs)\\nto symbolically represent and model-check huge Kripke structures.\\n\\n\\n Requirements: Students will be expected to participate in class.\\nThere will be three problem sets concerning the introductory material on\\nfirst-order and modal logic.  Each student will choose a more advanced\\ntopic to study in detail.  He or she will write a short paper and give a\\nlecture on this topic.\\nTexts: For first-order logic, we will follow Logic and\\nStructure, Third Edition, by Dirk van Dalen, Springer-Verlag.  This is\\navailable at the Jeffery Amherst College Store in downtown Amherst.\\nFor the rest of the course, we will follow selected research papers.\\nPrerequisites: Sufficient mathematical sophistication.  If you are\\nunsure whether you have it, try looking at van Dalen and/or come\\ntalk with me.\\nNotes and Handouts: \\n Notes:\\nSept. 4, 1996\\n Notes:\\nSept. 9, 1996\\n Notes:\\nSept. 11, 1996, plus first problem set, Due: 9/25/96\\n We have finished Propositional Logic and begun Predicate Logic.  See:\\nNotes:\\nSept. 16, 1996\\n On Wednesday, Oct. 2, I proved the Completeness Theorem and the\\nCompactness Theorem for predicate logic.  You should have read van Dalen\\nthrough page 118.  Note that in this course we are only interested in the\\ncountable case, so you do not need to worry about larger cardinalities nor\\ndo you have to remember Zorn\\'s lemma.\\n\\n On Monday, Oct. 7, I introduced Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse games.  These are\\nthe best and most pleasant way to figure out what can and cannot be\\nexpressed in first-order logics.  By then you should have read the handout\\npebble games\\nfrom my forthcoming book,  Descriptive Complexity.  \\n\\n On Wednesday, Oct. 9, I finished the introduction to Predicate Logic.  By now,\\nplease skim the rest of Chapter 3 of van Dalen.  Topics that you should pay\\nparticular attention to are: substructures, isomorphism, elementary\\nequivalence, and skolemization.\\n\\n Second\\nProblem Set, Due: Oct. 16, 1996\\n   On Oct. 16 I introduced Evolving\\nAlgebra.  Please read the\\nEvolving\\nAlgebra Tutorial, and the paper guide.ps.  These are available as \\npostscript files from anonymous FTP site, ftp.eecs.umich.edu, directory\\n/groups/Ealgebras, files tutorial.ps and guide.ps.\\n\\n On Oct. 21, I concluded my presentation of Evolving Algebras, using\\nthe paper, \"Why Use Evolving Algebras for Hardware and Software\\nEngineering,\" by Egon Börger, Proc. SOFSEM\\'95, Springer LNCS.  Also\\navailable on the Evolving\\nAlgebra Homepage.  I also talked briefly about Denotational Semantics,\\nusing Denotational Semantics by Joseph Stoy, 1977, M.I.T. Press,\\nChapter 9, by way of comparison.\\n\\n On Oct. 23, 28, and 30, I will give a three-lecture introduction to modal logics,\\nemphasizing temporal logic and logics of knowledge.  Please read the article by\\nVardi, ``Why is Modal Logic So Robustly Decidable?\\'\\' which I handed out. I\\nwill also use some material from the book by Fagin, Halpern, Moses, and Vardi,\\nReasoning about Knowledge, 1995, M.I.T. press.\\n\\n On Monday, Nov. 4, I will talk about about an interesting paper that uses\\nlogic of knowledge to discuss security in distributed systems: \\nA\\nLogic of Authentication by Burrows, Abadi, and Needham.  Please read\\nthis paper before the class.\\n\\n On Wednesday, Nov. 6 through Monday, Nov. 18, I will talk about Lamport\\'s \\nTemporal Logic of Actions.\\n\\n You might want to look at the following webpage which has many\\npointers to work going on in formal methods:  Formal Methods Pointers\\n On Wednesday, Nov. 20, I will start talking about Computation Tree\\nLogic and Model Checking.  For a preview, take at look at the following homepage:\\nModel\\nChecking at CMU.\\n\\n Available slots for student lectures are: Nov. 27, Dec. 2, Dec. 4, and\\nDec. 11.  I suggest that you get your reservations in early!\\n\\n There will be no class on Monday, Dec. 9.\\n\\n\\n'}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www-osl.cs.umass.edu^~moss^610', 'pagename': 'CMP SCI 610/410(491A) - Translator Design', 'content': 'Date: Wednesday, 20-Nov-96 23:21:26 GMT\\nServer: NCSA/1.3\\nMIME-version: 1.0\\nContent-type: text/html\\nLast-modified: Wednesday, 20-Nov-96 15:19:49 GMT\\nContent-length: 2753\\n\\n\\nCMP SCI 610/410(491A) - Translator Design\\n\\n\\nCMP SCI 610/410(491A) - Translator Design - Fall 1996\\n\\nInstructor:\\n    J.

Students who have not taken these\\nclasses, or similar classes taught at another university, should NOT register\\nfor Comp 202, despite what your advisor or other students may tell you.

However, I think this is a risky course of action for most\\npeople.)\\n\\n\\nAnother Note: Comp 122 mentioned in the previous paragraph is the \" new\\n\" Comp 122, which is a course intended for undergraduates.

I plan\\nto review this material with blazing speed.  If you\\'ve taken the 122\\nprerequisite, then reading these chapters shouldn\\'t pose any serious problems\\nfor you.  This textbook is a quick read.  Latest word on textbooks: I\\'m told\\nthat there are 90 copies at the bookstore, with more on backorder.  (Why they\\'ve\\nordered more is a mystery to me -- maybe it\\'s because 122 is using the same\\nbook.)  The edition is the same as last year: the 1990 edition.

It will be shown how a construction\\nembedding an affine space into a vector space, where points\\nand vectors can be treated uniformly, together with polar forms, \\nyield a very elegant and effective treatment of tangents and\\nosculating flats. The conditions for joining polynomial curves\\nwill be derived using polar forms, and this will lead to\\na treatment of B-splines in terms of polar forms. In particular,\\nthe de Boor algorithm will be derived as a natural extension of\\nthe de Casteljau algorithm. \\nRectangular (tensor product) Be'zier surfaces, and triangular\\nBe'zier surfaces will also be introduced using polar forms,\\nand the de Casteljau algorithm will be derived.\\nSubdivision algorithms and their application to\\nrendering will be discussed extensively.\\nJoining conditions will be derived\\nusing polar forms. \\n\\nUsing the embedding\\nof an affine space into a vector space, we will contruct the\\nprojective completion of an affine space, and show how\\nrational curves can be dealt with as central projections\\nof polynomial curves, with appropriate generalizations\\nof the de Casteljau algorithm. \\n\\nRational surfaces will be obtained as central projections\\nof polynomial surfaces.  \\nIf time permits, NURBS and\\ngeometric continuity will be discussed.\\nThis will require a little bit of \\ndifferential geometry. \\n\\nA class-room treatment of curves and surfaces in terms of polar forms\\nis rather new (although\\nused at Stanford by Leo Guibas and Lyle Ramshaw),  but should be \\nilluminating and exciting.\\nSince books (even recent) do not follow such an approach,\\nI have written extensive course notes, which  will be available. \\n\\nI will mix assignments not involving programming, and\\nsmall programming projects.\\nThere are plenty of opportunities for trying out\\nthe algorithms presented in the course. In particular,\\nit is fairly easy to program many of these algorithms in Mathematica\\n(I have done so, and I'm not such a great programmer!). \\n\\nAt the end of the course, you will know how to write your  own \\nalgorithms to display the half Klein bottle shown below.\\n Half Klein bottle\\n\\n\\n\\npublished by:\\nJean Gallier\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cis.upenn.edu^~lee^cse480', 'pagename': 'CSE 480 Home Page', 'content': 'Server: Netscape-Communications/1.1\\nDate: Wednesday, 20-Nov-96 23:24:39 GMT\\nLast-modified: Monday, 09-Sep-96 16:30:45 GMT\\nContent-length: 2559\\nContent-type: text/html\\n\\n\\n\\nCSE 480 Home Page\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   If you were using a Java-enabled browser,\\n   you would see an animated scrolling text sign here.\\n   \\n\\nCSE480: Distributed and Real-Time System -

Personal Computers\\n(PCs) are available in the Crawford Hall third floor lab and in the\\nlibrary. The class project development must be performed and the\\ntarget program executed on PCs. Project documents are in PC\\nMicroSoft Word 6.0 format. The use of home PCs or PCs at your \\nworkplace (if permitted by your employer) is also approved. When\\nindividual assignments require submittal in machine readable form,\\nfloppy disk (PC 3.5\" HD) must be used.\\nGRADING: You will be graded on your homework\\nassignments, participation in class, and two examinations: a\\nmid-term and a final. Grading will be based on the following\\nrelative weights:\\n\\nProject Grade (inc. homework) \\n50%\\n\\nMid-Term Examination \\n15%\\n\\nFinal Examination \\n30%\\n\\nClass Participation \\n5%\\n\\nTotal:\\n100%\\n\\nCOLLABORATION: Collaboration or \"working together\"\\nis ESSENTIAL to this course. You are authorized full communication\\nwith any other class member concerning the project we will be \\nundertaking.\\nCONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS: You will each have an\\narea of primary responsibility as part of the class team executing\\nthe class project. The Quality Assurance Manager and the Configuration\\nManager will enforce the standards for the class. The Independent\\nVerification and Validation engineer will further evaluate \\nconformance as an agent of the \"customer\" (instructor). Conformance\\nto the standards is clearly to your benefit, besides which, \\nexperience has shown that adherence to standards results in producing\\nworking programs in less time.\\nTURNING IN ASSIGNMENTS: For each of the\\nassignments, you should turn in your solution. To each, attach an\\nassignment coversheet that includes your name, student number,\\ne-mail address, a telephone number where you can be contacted,\\nand a summary of your individual task. Also include any comments\\nyou want the instructor to see.\\nLATE ASSIGNMENTS: In general, late assignments\\nwill NOT be accepted. In those cases where the instructor chooses\\nto accept them, a severe grading penalty will apply. Remember that\\nall of the other students, your development teammates, will depend\\non your contribution to the project.\\nCLASS SCENARIO:\\n\\n  You have recently been hired by a prestigious software company\\n  because the company has just won one of two contracts to upgrade\\n  a Government developed training aid called the Low Cost Flight\\n  Simulator (LCFS). At the end of the development phase, a single\\n  contract will be awarded to the company that wins a competitive\\n  product \"fly-off\" demonstration. Your company\\'s future depends\\n  on winning this competition. Your talent-laden tiger team must \\n  develop the upgrade to this product to allow it to win the\\n  fly-off. Product maintainability is included in the criteria\\n  for final product evaluation. You have 15 working weeks to\\n  complete the task and have the upgrade ready for the fly-off\\n  demonstration.\\n\\n\\n-- Return to top, or:\\n1. Fact Sheet; 2. \\n  Syllabus; 3.

It will be\\navailable as it gets completed.  The first chapter will be free, following\\nwhich you will be given a chance to be a subscriber at a fixed estimated\\ncost.  Subscribers get the rest of the notes, loose-leaf and 3-hole punched.\\n\\nDavid H. Friedel, Jr. and Anthony Potts, \\n\\nJava Programming Language Handbook,\\nCoriolis Group Books, 1996, ISBN 1-883577-77-2.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCourse Assumptions\\n\\nStudents should have had a first course in computing at the college\\nlevel (e.g. CS5).  Prior experience in C or C++ is preferred although\\nnot essential.  We will be using a number of different languages, including\\nJava, \\na simplified derivative of C++.\\nIt is possible to have only a knowledge of Pascal, rather than C++, when you start.\\nThis is fine, as long as you don\\'t freak because of language syntax.\\nYou should know about procedures, arrays, and\\ntypes at a minimum; if you are unfamiliar with these, please take CS5, 6\\nor 50 first.\\n\\n\\nIs this a \"Programming Course\"?\\n\\nIn a sense, it is: much of the course entails programming.\\nHowever, we  consider exposure\\nto computer science ideas to be the important part.  The intent of the\\nprogramming assignments is to drive home these key ideas.\\n\\n\\nLectures\\n\\nThe word \"lecture\" below is used very loosely.  I expect that the lecture\\nperiods will include some traditional-style lecturing, but hope it will be more like a \\nmultilogue (set of dialogues).  You are expected to attend, ask\\nquestions, and provide comments.\\n\\nI am planning to lecture 50-60 about minutes of the 75 minutes we have allocated\\nin each session.\\nThe rest of the time will be for the purpose of answering extended questions\\nand going into more specifics of some of the programming techniques and\\nexamples.  If you don\\'t have things to ask of me in this remaining time, I may\\nask some things of you (e.g. a quiz).\\n\\nThreads\\n\\nThere are essentially three interwoven \"threads\" in the course: The book,\\nthe problems, and the lectures.  I try to keep them \"in synch\" with one\\nanother, but active participation in all three threads is required.\\nVolume-wise, the book covers more material than can be discussed in the\\nlecture.  The lecture will cover some things not in the book.\\nStaying attune to what is going on in lecture will help you focus on\\nthe areas in the book that are important as far as exam emphasis.  \\nThe problems exercise some, but not all, of the\\nthings discussed in the book and lecture.\\n\\nCourse Resources\\n\\nThe course is planned to be interactive throughout.  We are eager to\\nprevent programming difficulties from consuming extraordinary time, so\\nplease ask when you get stuck with such difficulties.  It is\\nmuch more efficient to start early on each assignment so that\\nyou give yourself enough time to cope with the numerous contingencies\\nwhich inevitably materialize.  You can get help on-line by emailing to\\ncs60help@muddcs which goes to the graders/tutors and to me.  I don\\'t\\nencourage use of \\'talk\\' because it is too slow, but I check email often.  When\\nyou email a message, it will typically be answered to the entire class\\nwith parts of your message embedded.  If you do not want it to be\\nattributed to you, please so indicate in your message.  \\n\\nBy carrying problem solutions through to computer implementation, you\\nare showing that you understand the issues, principles, and\\ntechniques.  I or the tutors will explain to you how to work any problem, to any\\nlevel of detail, if you ask.  However, you must do so with a\\nsufficient time margin.  Telling us at the eleventh hour that you just\\naren\\'t getting it and therefore want to drop the course is not availing\\nyourself of the substantial help available.\\n\\n You are also welcome to submit email with any\\nquestion you\\'d like to have answered or any point you would like\\naddressed after lecture, or leave a note in my mailbox in 240\\nOlin.  Of course you are encouraged to ask such questions in class as\\nwell.  \\n\\n\\nThere are many tools available on muddcs itself.  Use the\\n\\'man\\' feature of UNIX to find what you need and to explore.  The command \\n\\n    man command\\n\\ngives information on a specific command; \\nThe command \\n\\n    man -k topic\\n\\nlists commands relating to a specific topic.  You can also\\nuse the \\'info\\' reader in GNU Emacs for certain library, language, and editor\\nspecifics.  In Emacs type \\n\\n    escape-X info\\n\\nEmacs is a very powerful editor which is going to be around for a long time; it\\nis highly encouraged that you learn to use it.\\nHelpful information, examples, on-line copies of\\nassignments, etc. will be kept in various subdirectories of the\\ndirectory \\n\\n/cs/cs60\\n\\non machine muddcs.  There is a web page for rex and ISCAL documentation.  Finally, the \"corner\\nstore\" maxim applies: If you can\\'t find what you want, ask for\\nit. \\nGrading\\nThere will be approximately six graded assignments, most entailing programming.\\nProgramming assignments help drive home key working concepts and\\nprinciples.  Assignments vary in difficulty and will not necessarily be equally\\nweighted.  There will also be some assignments which you will not submit, but\\nshould do anyway because they will help you with other assignments.\\nThe languages for the graded assignments will probably be one in rex, two in Java,\\none in C++, one in Prolog,\\nand one in assembly language (ISCAL, for a simulated machine).  \\nSufficient information about the languages will be\\nprovided to enable you to complete the assignments; you do not have to know these\\nlanguages when you enter the class.\\n\\nHere is the nominal point breakdown we use on assignments.  This may vary somewhat,\\ndepending on the emphasis of the assignment.\\n  \\n40% for general correctness:\\n    \\n        The program should run according to specification,\\n        taking into account any DWIM (do-what-I-mean) situations\\n        (e.g. The professor says one thing but really meant something\\n        different;  Hopefully he or someone will catch this and\\n        say something about it before it goes too far.)\\n     \\n        We are a learning community here, so don\\'t just be silent about \\n        things that you think are errors.\\n     \\n20% for choice or discovery of algorithm:\\n    \\n        Sometimes the algorithm is given.  However, sometimes\\n        such clues are ignored, resulting in loss of points\\n        unnecessarily or unnecessary floundering.\\n    \\n        Some people find a better way than what was suggested.\\n        They get extra credit, at grader\\'s discretion.  \\n    \\n        (Note: \"better\" does not mean more obscure or\\n        cleverly hacked-up, but rather more elegant,\\n        or substantially more efficient.)\\n    \\n20% for documentation:\\n    \\n        Comments should be included in the code which expose the method,\\n        any subtleties, etc.\\n    \\n10% for style:\\n    \\n        The code should be readable without extraordinary effort.\\n        Use spacing, braces, etc. to improve readability.\\n        Layout characters are not at a premium, so use them liberally.\\n    \\n10% for robustness:\\n    \\n        The program should not break in unusual ways for minor input\\n        aberrations.\\n    \\n\\nRemember, you can always ask about things before you submit your actual product.\\nThere is no reason to lose points on most of the above.  \\nYou also lose no points or esteem for asking.\\n\\nTutoring\\nThe tutors are expected to play a key role in the course.  Everyone will need to interact\\nwith a tutor, even if you don\\'t need help:\\n\\n  \\n You will \"check in\" with your tutor\\n  on a regular basis, and show him/her your progress.  Checking in will be\\n  a part of your grade.\\n  \\n Your tutor will advise you on your approach to solving the problem,\\n  documentation, and presentation.\\n  \\n Your tutor will make an evaluation of your work when you are ready\\n  to submit it, and recommend a grade to me.\\n  \\n I will assign the grade for the assignment, based on the tutor\\'s \\n  recommendation, although I am not bound to follow the recommendation\\n  100%.\\n  \\n\\nNeither I nor the tutors are your adversaries.  We want you to succeed, but it\\nrequires effort, cooperation, and timing on your part.\\n\\nYour Directory ~/cs60\\nYou should have a directory ~/cs60 which has group access by group cs60.\\nIf not, the system administrator will create one for you.  Access to this\\ndirectory will thus be by you, the instructor, and the tutors, but preferrably\\nno one else.  When properly setup the directory listing, obtained by ls -l, for\\nthis directory should look like:\\n\\n   2 drwxrwx---   2 yourid     cs60         512 Sep  8 20:32 cs60/\\n\\nIf it does not, you should execute the following command from your home directory:\\n\\n   chmod 770 cs60\\n\\nThe purpose of\\nthis directory is to be able to get help on programs without mailing the program.\\nSimply indicate the file name to the instructor or tutor.  He or she can connect\\nto the directory and write things there.  It is not necessary that you keep all\\nof your work accessible there, just the things on which you are currently working.\\n\\nHonor Code Standard (Please read this carefully.) \\n\\nAlthough discussion of problems with others is encouraged,\\nprogramming in CS60 emphasizes individual learning, not group\\nprojects.  We observe the following Standard:  \"You may discuss the\\nassignment with other students.  You may not\\nshare [i.e. give or receive]\\nwritten work of any kind, inside or outside the course\".\\nElaboration:  In the case of programming assignments, we consider\\n\"written work\" to include email, computer files, fragments of files, and printed output.\\nIn developing code for a programming assignment, you can\\ndiscuss ideas with others, but discussion of ideas\\nmust not involve wholesale examination or \\ntranscription of the actual working code of\\nothers, with the exception that you may use any code explicitly\\nprovided by the instructor. \\n\\nThe following types of activities have occurred in the past.  They have, in\\nmost cases, resulted in receiving a failing grade in the course, \\none or more appearances before the judicial board (with the attendant\\nblighted record), and in some cases eventual ITR (Ineligible to Register) status.\\n\\n\\nTwo or more students split up an assignment, then transcribe each others\\' contributions,\\nsometimes changing names of variables, comments, formatting, etc.  \\n\\n\\nA student browses the directories of other students and finds someone\\'s\\nhomework file unprotected.  He makes a copy of the file and edits it\\nas above to try to make it look like his own.\\n\\nYou would be surprised how easy it is for a grader to spot violations.\\nIf you have any doubts about whether a form of\\ninteraction constitutes a violation of this standard, please consult\\nwith me prior to continuing.\\n\\nIf you get significant, but legitimate, help from another, you should acknowledge\\nit on your submission.  You do not lose credit for this.  It is only\\nproper to acknowledge the other person.\\n\\nGrading Weights\\nHere is how your overall grade is determined:\\n\\n50% programming assignments\\n\\n25% final-examination\\n\\n15% mid-term examination\\n\\n10% attendance, participation, tutor-checkin, and random quizzes\\n\\nExams are open book and emphasize conceptual understanding, rather\\nthan memorization of fine details.  \\n\\nLate Assignment Policy\\n\\nSubmissions are done by following the instructions below,\\nwhich also establishes the time of submission.\\nThe due dates on assignments should be noted carefully.\\nThe work of an assignment should be conducted in the week or weeks\\nbefore, not on the last day when there is no space for the necessary\\nthinking.  \\n\\nAutomatic Grace\\nThere is an automatic, fixed, one-day grace period on all assignments.  \\nIn other words, if the due date\\nstates day N, then the assignment must be turned in before midnight on\\nday N+1 to receive any credit.  After midnight on day N+1 work you\\nspend on the problem is for you own edification only (which is not \\nto say that it isn\\'t worth doing or required; you just don\\'t get\\npoints for it then).  It is best to plan to get the assignments in\\non the stated due date.\\n\\nCS 60 Topic Outline\\n\\nThe lectures will roughly follow this outline.  The progression is at\\nthe rate of about two of the numbered topics below per week.  I should\\nsay that this is what I would like to do.  Depending on background,\\nsome of the topics expand to longer than allocated, with the result\\nthat other topics get jettisoned or fall off the end.  Please keep up\\non the reading without it being explicitly assigned.  The notes\\ngenerally expand on the lectures and discussions.  But the lectures\\nmay also expand on the notes or introduce new material.  More often\\nthan not, several threads will be interwoven in the lectures over a\\nperiod of time, in part to emphasize the commonality of concepts from\\ndifferent vantage points.  Brackets below indicate where chapters in\\nthe notes start with respect to the concepts that follow.  The outline\\ndoes not mention every topic.

Shortly thereafter (usually a few seconds), you\\nwill recieve by e-mail an exact copy of what was submitted.  You\\nwill notice that some headers are attached, containing certain\\nessential information.  These headers are commented out so that compilation\\nof the program is not affected.  If what you recieve is not\\nacceptable (e.g. becomes MIME encoded because it is more than 80 columns or contains\\ncontrol characters), you are responsible for noticing this\\nimmediately, correcting the file, and re-submitting it.  All submissions\\nwill be kept for archival purposes, but only the latest submission before\\nthe time deadline will be graded.\\n\\n\\n'}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cs.hmc.edu^~hadas^courses^cs6^index', 'pagename': 'The CS 6 Homepage', 'content': \"Date: Tue, 26 Nov 1996 18:40:41 GMT\\nServer: NCSA/1.5.1\\nLast-modified: Fri, 08 Dec 1995 19:16:57 GMT\\nContent-type: text/html\\nContent-length: 895\\n\\n\\n\\nThe CS 6 Homepage\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n The CS 6 Homepage\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Study Guide for the Final Exam \\n\\n\\n Syllabus  \\n\\n How to Submit Your Homework  \\n\\n Programming Assignments \\n\\n\\n How to Scan in Images! \\n\\n\\n Ran's Homepage \\n\\n \\nLast modified October 1, 1995 by hadas@cs.hmc.edu\\n\\n\\n\"}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cs.hmc.edu^~hodas^courses^cs5^index', 'pagename': 'CS 5 Home Page', 'content': 'Date: Tue, 26 Nov 1996 18:40:43 GMT\\nServer: NCSA/1.5.1\\nLast-modified: Mon, 25 Nov 1996 00:21:43 GMT\\nContent-type: text/html\\nContent-length: 9168\\n\\nCS 5 Home Page\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCourse Home\\nSyllabus\\nHomework Submission\\nHomework Solutions\\nLab Solutions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Concepts\\n      Keywords\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCS 5 Home Page\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nFor the Fall of 1996, CS 5, \"Structured Programming and Problem Solving\", is being\\ntaugh in an experimental format relying on web-based notes, recitation/Q&A sessions,\\nand hands-on lab sessions. \\n\\nThe material has been divided up along the lines of calendar weeks.\\nA \"week\" consists of:\\n\\nA set of lecture notes, to be studied\\nin advance (presumably over the weekend) of the recitation/Q&A session on Monday\\nA set of lab problems to reinforce the ideas in the that week\\'s notes, \\nto be done in lab on Tuesday or Wednesday (depending on your assigned lab section)\\nA homework assignment to reinforce and test\\nthe ideas in the lecture, to be worked on that week and due the following Tuesday.\\n\\nNote that the homework for a given week overlaps into the next week. \\nThis allows you to use a second recitation to ask any lingering\\nquestions before the assignment is due.\\n\\nThe following list gives you direct access to the lecture notes,\\nlab problems, and homework problems for each week.

A background of several\\nupper\\xad division courses, particularly Algorithms, would be helpful but\\nis not absolutely necessary.\\n\\nIn Mathematics, students should have taken at least one course which\\ncontains formal definitions, theorems, and proofs.  Linear Algebra is\\nusually such a course.  There will be some basic number theory that\\nwill be covered along the way, so students should be comfortable\\nreading, understanding, and discussing mathematical topics.\\n\\nMaterials:\\n  There is no textbook to purchase.  We will be\\nusing books and journal articles from the libraries and resources from\\nthe web.  Some of these will be mentioned in class; others will be\\ndiscovered by members of the class.  Expect to spend some time in the\\nlibrary, and see the note below on the bibliography project.\\n\\nTopics:\\n  The seminar is about systems for encryption and\\nauthentication, with an emphasis on mathematical foundations and\\nalgorithms.  Although implementations, social issues, and legal\\nquestions are important, they are of secondary interest.  The specific\\ntopics will depend on the interests of the participants and the\\navailable resources.\\n\\nRequirements and Grading:\\n  Each student will carry out a\\nresearch project during the semester.  We will discuss possible topics\\nby the third or fourth week of the semester.  A proposal, with a topic\\nand a list of possible sources, is due on March 7.  A paper of\\napproximately ten pages is due on April 30.\\n\\nThe seminar will consist primarily of student presentations and\\ndiscussion.  Each student will make two to four presentations, one of\\nwhich will be a report on the student's project.\\n\\nGrades will be determined by the project, seminar presentations,\\nparticipation in discussion, and contributions to the bibliography.\\n\\nOffice Hours:\\n  Mondays 1:15-2:30, Tuesdays 11-12,\\nFridays 11-12, and by appointment.

Algorithms, complexity\\nanalysis, data structuring, data and procedural abstraction, grammars, \\ncorrectness, logic principles, processor organization, operating system \\nconcepts, programming languages, basic automata theory, and theoretical \\nlimitations.\\n\\nCourse Goals\\n\\nTo learn and apply basic principles of computer science, including\\nsoftware construction, hardware organization, and limitations of\\ncomputers.  \\n\\nText\\nRobert M. Keller,  Principles of Computing, January 1996.\\nAvailable by one-time special order for $29 (cost of reproduction)\\nand it is strongly recommended that you buy a copy.\\n\\nThe entire book is also on-line in Microsoft word on KATO, the Mac\\nserver, in the folder KATO.HOME/Department Homes/CS/CS 60/.  It will\\nbe thus viewable from Macs on the local network.  I will see about\\ngetting a PC version as well.  However, it is still\\nrecommended that you purchase the book (rather than, say getting\\nsomeone\\'s old version) because: (1) The book has been revised\\nsubstantially since the last course offering.  (2) The book is large\\n(750 pages), and reading it all on the screen is apt to be tiresome\\nand inconvenient.  (3) The book can be taken into the exams, whereas a\\nMac cannot be.\\n\\n\\nCourse Assumptions\\n\\nStudents should have had a first course in computing at the college\\nlevel (e.g. CS5).  Prior experience in C or C++ is preferred although\\nnot essential.  Others have made it through starting with just a\\nknowledge of Pascal.  You should know about procedures, arrays, and\\ntypes at a minimum; if you are unfamiliar with these, please take CS5\\nor CS50 first.\\n\\n\"Lectures\"\\n\\nThe word \"lecture\" below is used very loosely.  I expect that the lecture\\nperiods will include some explanation, but will be more like a \\nmultilogue (set of dialogues).  You are expected to attend, ask\\nquestions, and provide comments.\\n\\nThreads\\n\\nThere are essentially three interwoven \"threads\" in the course: The book,\\nthe problems, and the lectures.  I try to keep them \"in synch\" with one\\nanother, but active participation in all three threads is required.\\nVolume-wise, the book covers more material than can be discussed in the\\nlecture.  The lecture will cover some things not in the book.\\nStaying attune to what is going on in lecture will help you focus on\\nthe areas in the book that are important as far as exam emphasis.  \\nThe problems exercise some, but not all, of the\\nthings discussed in the book and lecture.\\n\\nResources\\n\\nThe course is planned to be interactive throughout.  We are eager to\\nprevent programming difficulties from consuming extraordinary time, so\\nplease ask when you get stuck with such difficulties.  It is\\nmuch more efficient to start early on each assignment so that\\nyou give yourself enough time to cope with the numerous contingencies\\nwhich inevitably materialize.  You can get help on-line by emailing to\\ncs60help@muddcs which goes to the graders/tutors and to me.  I don\\'t\\nenable \\'talk\\' because it is too slow, but I check email often.  When\\nyou email a message, it will typically be answered to the entire class\\nwith parts of your message embedded.  If you do not want it to be\\nattributed to you, please so indicate in your message.  \\n\\nBy carrying problem solutions through to computer implementation, you\\nare showing that you understand the issues, principles, and\\ntechniques.  I will explain to you how to work any problem, to any\\nlevel of detail, if you ask.  However, you must do so with a\\nsufficient time margin.  Telling me at the eleventh hour that you just\\naren\\'t getting and therefore want to drop the course is not availing\\nyourself of the substantial help available.\\n\\n You are also welcome to submit email or a note card with any\\nquestion you\\'d like to have answered or any point you would like\\naddressed before or after class, or leave it in my mailbox in 240\\nOlin.  Of course you are encouraged to ask such questions in class as\\nwell.  There are many tools available on the computer itself.  Use the\\n\\'man\\' feature of UNIX to find what you need and to explore.  (The command \\n\\nman command\\n\\ngives information on a specific command; \\nThe command \\n\\nman -k topic\\n\\nlists commands relating to a specific topic.)  You can also\\nuse the \\'info\\' reader in GNU Emacs for certain library, language, and editor\\nspecifics.  In emacs type \\n\\nescape-X info\\n\\nHelpful information, examples, on-line copies of\\nassignments, etc. will be kept in various subdirectories of the\\ndirectory \\n\\n/cs/cs60\\n\\non machine muddcs.  There is a web page for rex documentation.  Finally, the \"corner\\nstore\" maxim applies: If you can\\'t find what you want, ask for\\nit. \\nGrading\\nThere will be approximately eight assignments entailing programming.\\nProgramming assignments help drive home key working concepts and\\nprinciples.  After the first couple of assignments, where the rex\\nlanguage (one you have not likely seen) is used, the language used will\\nmostly be C++.  C++ is used due to its position as an emergent\\nindustry standard and its ability to reflect both low-level computer\\nstructure and at the same time provide high-level data and object\\nabstractions.  There will may be one assignment in assembly-language\\nprogramming, using a simulated computer, the ISC.  As prior exposure\\nto C++ varies across the class, I will hold one or more special\\nevening sessions for C++ if you so request.\\n\\nIs this a \"Programming Course\"?\\n\\nAlthough much of the course entails programming, we  consider exposure\\nto computer science ideas to be the important part.  The intent of the\\nprogramming assignments is to drive home these key ideas.  I am\\nwilling to devote as much of each class period as is needed (nominally\\n15 minutes) to more detailed examples of programming techniques and\\nfor specific programming questions and answers.  If this does not\\nappear useful on a given day, the time will be used for other\\npurposes.   \\n\\n\\nHonor Code Standard\\nRead this carefully:\\nAlthough discussion of problems with others is encouraged,\\nprogramming in CS60 emphasizes individual learning rather than group\\nprojects.  We observe the following Standard:  \"You may discuss the\\nassignment with other students.  You may not\\nshare (= give or receive)\\nwritten work of any kind, inside or outside the course\".\\nElaboration:  In the case of programming assignments, we consider\\nemail, computer files, fragments of files, and printed output to be \"written\\nwork\".  In developing code for a programming assignment, you can\\ndiscuss ideas with others, but discussion of ideas\\nmust not involve wholesale examination or \\ntranscription of the actual working code of\\nothers, with the exception that you may use any code explicitly\\nprovided by the instructor. Definitely\\nforbidden is a form of collaboration wherein two or more students\\nsplit up an assignment, then transcribe each others\\' contributions,\\nsometimes changing names of variables, comments, formatting, etc.  \\nIf this occurs, a failing grade is issued automatically.\\nIf the help you get from another is significant, you should acknowledge\\nit on your submission.  You do not lose credit for this.\\nIf you have any doubts about whether a form of\\ninteraction constitutes a violation of this standard, please consult\\nwith me prior to continuing.\\n\\nGrading Weights\\nThe programming assignments will constitute 50% of the grade.  The\\nmid-term examination will count 15% and the final 25%.  Class\\nattendance, participation, random quizzes, etc. will account for the\\nremaining 10%.  Various \"practice problems\" will be indicated.  In\\nparticular, you should be able to work most ** (\"two dot\") problem in\\nthe notes relating to material covered in lecture.  These do not need\\nto be submitted, but the exams will consist largely of problems of a\\nsimilar level, along with some perhaps a little easier or harder.\\nExams are open book and emphasize conceptual understanding, rather\\nthan memorization of fine details.  \\n\\nLate Assignment Policy\\n\\nSubmissions are done by emailing source code to the grader,\\ncs60grad@muddcs, which also establishes the time of submission.\\nThe due dates on assignments should be noted carefully.\\nThe work of an assignment should be conducted in the week or weeks\\nbefore, not on the last day when there is no space for the necessary\\nthinking.  \\nThere is an automatic, fixed, one-day grace period on all assignments.  \\nIn other words, if the due date\\nstates day N, then the assignment must be turned in before midnight on\\nday N+1 to receive any credit.  After midnight on day N+1 work you\\nspend on the problem is for you own edification only (which is not \\nto say that it isn\\'t worth doing or required; you just don\\'t get\\npoints for it then).  It is best to plan to get the assignments in\\non the stated due date.\\n\\nCS 60 Topic Outline\\n\\nThe lectures will roughly follow this outline.  The progression is at\\nthe rate of about two of the numbered topics below per week.  I should\\nsay that this is what I would like to do.  Depending on background,\\nsome of the topics expand to longer than allocated, with the result\\nthat other topics get jettisoned or fall off the end.  Please keep up\\non the reading without it being explicitly assigned.  The notes\\ngenerally expand on the lectures and discussions.  But the lectures\\nmay also expand on the notes or introduce new material.  More often\\nthan not, several threads will be interwoven in the lectures over a\\nperiod of time, in part to emphasize the commonality of concepts from\\ndifferent vantage points.  Brackets below indicate where chapters in\\nthe notes start with respect to the concepts that follow.  The outline\\ndoes not mention every topic.  The actual lectures determine points of\\nemphasis.\\n\\n\\n[Computing by the Rules]  Computation problems and models of\\ncomputation. States and transitions.  List notation.

Your core activity will\\nbe to implement a variety of object-oriented language mechanisms using\\nScheme. We will develop a core language implementation, and the programming\\nassignments will typically involve extending this core in various ways.\\nThis should give you a chance to spend less time coding and more time thinking.\\n\\nWe will spend a significant part of our lecture time discussing the\\nassignments and presenting solutions. The problems tend to be open-ended,\\nand we learn a lot from seeing how others approach a problem. These are\\nnot formal presentations, and you should come to every class prepared to\\npresent your current work. \\nAround the middle of the term, you will also be asked to pick a topic\\nfor a short paper. The paper will address one of the topics raised in the\\ncourse, and should involve a literature survey as well as some original\\nthought. The paper will be due by the end of finals week. I will probebly\\nrequire paper drafts at some point in November so I can give you some early\\nfeedback. \\n\\n\\nHow\\nto setup Chez Scheme in your environment. \\nHow\\nto setup emacs to run Scheme. \\nThe\\nInternet Scheme Repository \\nThe\\nR4RS Scheme Standard Definition (HTML) \\nThe\\nR4RS Scheme Standard Defintion (PS) \\nSchemers, Inc.

Because it is a video course, it needs to meet in one of\\nthe College of Engineering studios.  The largest studio holds 60\\nstudents.  Therefore, we can accommodate only 60 on-campus students.\\n\\nSince several students drop the course during the semester, we have\\nincreased the enrollment limit for CSC 517 to 80.  This means that not\\nall students will fit in the studio.  Consequently, lectures during\\nthe first month of the course will also be shown in an oveflow room\\nwhich, unfortunately, does not have a two-way audio/video link with\\nthe studio; thus students watching from that room will not be able to\\nask questions.

The problems are\\ngenerally pencil-and-paper problems, although it is not inappropriate to apply\\ncomputing resources.  Model solutions will be made available on specified due\\ndates.  The principal incentive for doing homework (aside from intellectual\\ncuriosity!) is to be prepared for exams; no explicit credit will be given for\\nhomework.  (If available TA resources permit, some problem sets will be\\ncollected and selected problems will be read and commented upon.)  Since no\\ngrades are assigned, you are free to work together; however, it is\\nimportant at exam time that you be able to write up solutions in your own\\nwords.  One approach might be to meet with other students to discuss and\\nperhaps solve problems, then reconstruct the solution later without using\\nnotes.\\n\\nApproximate Schedule:\\n\\n 8/22 Introduction;  Sec. 1\\n 8/27 Asymptotics, Summations;  Sec. 2, Sec. 3\\n 8/29 Divide and Conquer, Recurrences;  Sec. 31.2, Sec. 4; \\nHW1 due\\n 9/3 Quicksort;   Sec. 8\\n 9/5 Order Statistics;  Sec. 10 \\n 9/10 Heapsort, Lower Bounds;   Sec. 7, Sec. 9.1;\\nHW2 due\\n 9/12 Linear-time Sorts;  Sec. 9.2-4\\n 9/17 Leftist and Skew Heaps;   \\nnotes\\n & Sec. 18.1-3\\n 9/19 Review; \\nHW3 due\\n 9/24 Exam 1\\n\\nLast year's exam\\n 9/26 Binomial & Fibonacci Heaps;   Sec. 20, Sec. 21  \\n 10/1  Disjoint Sets;  Sec. 22\\n 10/3  Graphs;   Sec. 23.1;   \\nHW4 due\\n 10/8 Depth- and Breadth-First Search;   Sec. 23.2-3  \\n 10/10 Applications of Depth-First Search;   Sec. 23.4-5\\n 10/17 Minimum Spanning Trees;   Sec. 24;\\n 10/22 Single-Source Shortest Paths;   Sec. 25\\n 10/24 Greedy Algorithms;   Sec. 17\\n 10/29 Review;  \\nHW5,HW6 due;\\n 10/31 Exam 2\\n\\nLast year's exam\\n 11/5 P and NP;  Sec. 36.1-2  \\n 11/7 NP-completeness;  Sec. 36.3-5\\n 11/12 NP-completeness;    \\n 11/14 Approximation Algorithms;  Sec. 37;\\nHW7 due\\n 11/19 Dynamic Programming;   Sec. 16.1-3\\n 11/21 All-Pairs Shortest Paths;   Sec. 26\\n 11/26 Fast Fourier Transform;  Sec. 32\\n 12/3 Computational Geometry;  Sec. 35;\\nHW8 due\\n 12/5 Review;\\nHW9 due\\n 12/10 Final Exam, 8:00-11:00\\n\\nLast year's final (closed-book)\\n\\n\\n\\ndwyer@csc.ncsu.edu Rex Dwyerupdated 8/20/96\\n\"}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.csc.ncsu.edu^eos^info^csc501_info^www^index', 'pagename': 'CSC/ECE 501 title page', 'content': 'Date: Tue, 26 Nov 1996 18:46:58 GMT\\nServer: NCSA/1.5.2\\nLast-modified: Thu, 01 Aug 1996 15:37:54 GMT\\nContent-type: text/html\\nContent-length: 1819\\n\\n\\nCSC/ECE 501 title page\\nCSC/ECE 501: Operating System Principles\\nSection 601 (this is not the Web page for Section 001)\\n\\n\\nOfficial entry from NCSU  Graduate\\nCatalog\\n\\n\\nCourse staff\\nInstructor:Edward F.\\nGehringer, 206 Daniels Hall, 515-2066, efg@ncsu.edu.

We \\nwill view the process in terms of its constituent tasks, focusing on the flow of information and \\ninterconnection between tasks.  We will highlight interdependencies created by work \\nproducts.  Our approach is in contrast to the traditional software engineering course (such as \\nthe prerequisite for this course) which focuses on the techniques employed to accomplish \\ntechnical activities.\\n\\nTopics to be covered include: software development paradigms (life cycles such as waterfall, \\nevolutionary, incremental, and spiral), software process maturity (Capability Maturity Model \\nand BOOTSTRAP Model), software process assessment and improvement, change \\nmanagement concepts, process and product metrics, organization and management \\nstrategies, and risk assessment.  Although we will study several management topics, this is \\nnot a course in software project management.  We will not cover how to manage people and \\nresources.  Project management will be discussed only as a constituent tasks in the overall \\ncontext of producing a software product.  Participation in class activities, some individual \\nactivities, a term project, and a final exam will be required.  Some additional effort will be \\nrequired for graduate credit.\\nPrerequisites\\nCS 381/581 Software Engineering or instructor's permission.  For NTU \\nstudents something equivalent to SE-710 or substantial work experience will be considered \\nequivalent.  Knowledge of modern software engineering techniques will be assumed.\\nComputer Access:  None required, but access to and use of Internet for course material and \\nelectronic mail is expected.\\nGoals\\nThe goal of this course is to provide a systematic study of the software\\ndevelopment process with an emphasis on how to define and manage it.  This course will expose \\nparticipants to several possible approaches to software development, identify the tasks that \\nare essential for successful projects, discuss how tasks interact with each other, and discuss \\nhow an organization can develop and mature its software development process.  The course \\nwill not advocate a particular development approach, but rather will take a critical look at the \\nmost popular and most talked about strategies.\\n\\nAfter successfully completing this course participants will:\\n\\nbe familiar with terminology used in this topical area  \\nhave read and analyzed important historical and current literature addressing \\nsoftware life cycle models and software process issues\\nunderstand the basic concepts embodied in the most prevalent software life cycle \\nmodels, including knowledge of their advantages and disadvantages, and when it \\nmay be appropriate to use each life cycle approach\\nbe able to construct and represent a software life cycle for an organization or project\\nbe able to construct a project software life cycle that is consistent with a specific \\nsoftware life cycle model\\nunderstand the factors that are important in building the capability or maturity of a \\nsoftware development organization\\nbe able to assess the maturity level of a software development organization\\nunderstand factors that contribute to successful process change implementation\\nbe able to plan and implement a software process improvement activity\\n\\nTexts\\nMark Paulk, et al., The Capability Maturity Model:  Guidelines for Improving the \\nSoftware Process, Addison Wesley, 1995.\\nJournal articles of historical or current importance and other material may be provided by the \\ninstructor.\\nAlternate Resources\\nIf you are interested in additional information on this subject, the \\nfollowing list presents some resources that you may find useful.  For this course you are not \\nrequired to have access to these resources and a student without access to them will not be at \\na disadvantage in this course.\\n\\nManaging the Software Process, Watts S.

Due to\\nslightly different schedules, off-campus and on-campus sections are graded separately.\\n\\nParticipation\\nAll students are expected to make a regular contribution to the class.\\nOn-campus students should be prepared to offer their comments regarding material presented, \\nask interesting questions during class, and respond with good answers to questions asked in \\nclass.  Calling to my attention a high quality article (not included in the course readings \\npackage) on a topic discussed in class is encouraged.  Off campus students should \\ncommunicate with me on a regular basis using telephone, fax, or e-mail to comment on \\nmaterial presented in class, to provide feedback on industry/practitioner perspectives \\nregarding topics studied, relate personal experiences relevant to class discussions, and of \\ncourse, to ask questions.  On-campus students may also make contribution via e-mail.  A \\nsignificant contribution about every other week is considered the minimum satisfactory\\nparticipation level.  \\nA portion of some class session will be devoted to discussion and feedback based on \\nquestions and comments supplied from off-campus.\\nAssignments\\nYou will be required to perform a software process assessment and to make a \\nreport of your findings.  You may evaluate a software development organization with which \\nyou are familiar or you may evaluate a case study I will make available.  As a practical \\napplication of some of the course material you will be expected to develop a process \\ndefinition/representation of a portion of your work function.  This process definition defines the \\ntasks and interfaces with other people and/or organizations.\\nOutside ReadingStudents enrolled for graduate credit (CS 585) will be required to read\\none book that is related to development life cycles, organizational maturity, or process \\nimprovement.  A list of acceptable books will be provided.\\nTerm ProjectThe course also requires an approved term project which should be a\\npractical application of some concept(s) studied in the course.  The project is expected to be more \\nextensive for graduate students than for undergraduates.  For the project you might prepare a \\nSoftware Management Plan following IEEE standards, develop a software process simulation \\nmodel of your organization, or study software process metrics from your organization.  You \\nare expected to propose a topic and receive my approval before starting.  Additional \\nguidelines will be provided on each of these activities.\\n\\nAll assignment, projects, etc. should be sent directly to me, not to the Video Outreach Office.  \\nThe address listed above will work for both US Mail, Federal Express, and UPS..  The final \\nexam must be sent by your examination coordinator to the Video Outreach Office.  You will \\nprobably want to keep a copy of all work that you submit just in case something gets lost in the \\nmail.  Unfortunately this does happen.\\nCourse Outline (approximate)\\n\\nI.

Beginning in Fall 95-96 these\\ncourses were split to better serve a diverse student population.\\n\\nPrerequisites:   (CS Majors) Certified for upper division course work \\nin computer science. (Non-CS Majors) Experience in \\ndevelopment of moderate sized programs in a structured, high-level language.  \\nKnowledge of C and Pascal programming is helpful \\nand the ability to read and understand simple C or Pascal programs is required.  \\nExamples in these languages will be used to \\nillustrate some fundamental programming ideas.\\n\\nTextbook:  Software Engineering: A Practitioner\\'s Approach, \\nFourth  Edition, Roger S. Pressman, McGraw-Hill, 1996. \\nClass Meetings:   The schedule is a guide to the coverage of course material.  \\nIn preparing for each class please read and study the appropriate material \\nin the text.  There will be self evaluation and assessment forms for\\nyou to complete on each reading assignment. We will also do in-class activities\\nto explore or solidify concepts.  Discussion is an important part of this course. \\nOutside reading in trade and professional publications is also \\nencouraged.  Some articles from professional journals may be provided for\\nreading.\\n\\nOther information sources:   There are a number of excellent publications \\nthat provide access to contemporary writings in \\nSoftware Engineering.  A number of these are listed in the section \\ndescribing the term project.  In addition, the Internet has a news \\nposting dedicated to discussion of general software engineering topics \\n(comp.software-eng) and there are additional \\nnews groups relating to special interest areas.\\n\\nHomework:   There will be about fifteen homework assignment given \\nin this course.  Normally, homework assignments are due at the start of \\nthe next class session.  If you are allowed additional time for a \\nparticular assignment it will be indicated in the instructions.  If your \\nresponse to the assignment requires more than one page, staple the pages \\ntogether in the upper left corner.  Make sure your name is on the first \\npage of the assignment.  \\n\\nExams:  A mid-term and a final exam will be given.  \\nThe exams will be given on the dates indicated in the course schedule.  \\n\\nCOURSE OVERVIEW \\n\\nThis course will study some of the major problem areas in software development \\nand will review, analyze, and apply many of the new techniques being used \\nin the development of medium to large scale software \\nsystems.  Although the emphasis for their development has stemmed \\nfrom large project environments, most \\nof the techniques can be easily adapted and applied to smaller projects \\nas well, with the similar expectations \\nof improved project performance.  This is not a programming project \\ncourse, but we will extensively study \\nthe software development process.  Major topics to be covered include: \\n\\n\\tSoftware Engineering Concepts & Historical Perspectives\\n\\tSoftware Life Cycle Paradigms\\n\\tSoftware Requirements Definition -- traditional and OO\\n\\tSoftware Design Methodologies -- traditional and OO\\n\\tVerification and Validation\\n\\tSoftware Quality\\n\\tManagement Considerations in Software Development\\n\\n\\nWe will also cover topics of contemporary importance including, \\nSoftware Quality Assurance, Total Quality Management, Object-Oriented \\nDevelopment, and Software Process Maturity.\\n\\nA \"survey\" textbook has been selected for use in this course, but the \\nmost up to date material can only be found in the recent technical \\nliterature.  Examples include the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, \\nIEEE Transactions on Reliability, IEEE Computer, Communications of the ACM, \\nACM SIGSOFT Notices, and IEEE Software.  Most of these are available at the \\nU of I library.  Selected articles may be assigned for reading and study \\nduring the semester to supplement the text.  Some of them will be discussed \\nin course lectures.\\n\\nA term project on an approved topic relating to a software engineering \\ndiscipline is also required.  In preparing the term project,you will \\nneed personal access to a reasonable technical library. \\n\\nGRADING\\nFinal course grades will be determined on the following basis: \\n\\n\\tCollected Homework\\t20 %\\t\\n\\tMid-term Exam (2)\\t20 %\\t\\n\\tTerm Project\\t\\t25 %\\t\\n\\tFinal Exam\\t\\t25 %\\t\\n\\tClass Participation\\t10 %\\t\\n\\nA numerical grading system will be employed with the final grade \\nbased on the weighted sum of the points accumulated in each of the \\nabove categories.  Final grades will be determined by a \"curve\" based \\non class performance, but in no case will the curve be more severe \\nthan a standard (90, 80, 70, etc.) curve.\\n\\n\\nCLASS PARTICIPATION\\nAll students are expected to make a regular contribution to the class.  \\nYou should be prepared to offer your\\ncomments regarding material presented, ask interesting questions during class, \\nand respond with good answers to questions asked in class.  You may also \\nmake contribution via e-mail.  A significant contribution about every other \\nweek is considered a satisfactory participation level.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Computer Science Home \\nPage\\n\\n Univ. of Idaho Home \\nPage \\n\\n\\nbilljunk@cs.uidaho.edu\\n\\n'}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cs.uidaho.edu^~frincke^classes^cs341', 'pagename': 'CS 341 Operating Systems', 'content': \"Date: Tue, 26 Nov 1996 19:05:54 GMT\\nServer: NCSA/1.4.1\\nContent-type: text/html\\nLast-modified: Thu, 09 Nov 1995 00:43:05 GMT\\nContent-length: 2591\\n\\n\\nCS 341 Operating Systems\\n\\n\\nCS 341 Operating Systems\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCS 341  Computer Operating Systems (4 cr).  \\nAnalysis and design of methods used by operating systems to perform \\ntypical system services; design and implementation of file and directory \\nsystems; I/O methods, including programmed, interrupt-driven, and DMA; \\nCPU scheduling; memory management techniques and implementations; \\nconcurrent programming; deadlocks; protection mechanisms; distributed \\nsystems; lab component focuses on implementation of several designs and \\nalgorithms discussed in lec.

The availability of ubiquitous network\\nconnections in conjuction with new software technologies have led to\\nthe emergence of the world largest client/server application, the WWW,\\nalso known as ``the last gold rush of the millennium.''\\nThe primary objective of this course is to examine the state of the art\\nand practice in distributed computing and to provide students hands-on\\nexperience in developing distributed protocols.\\n\\nThis course presents the dominant paradigms for building distributed\\nsystems/  applications including the traditional model of client-server\\ncomputing, distributed objects, group communication, remote-procedure\\ncalls, distributed shared memory, and the evolving model of distributed\\ncomputing on Web. The topics explored in this course include kernel\\nsupport for distributed systems, failure models and programming\\nparadigms, group multicast protocols, multicast over the Internet,\\nreplicated data management based on the state-machine and the\\nprimary-backup schemes, group membership protocols, clock\\nsynchronization and logical timestamps, the design of fault-tolerant\\nreal-time systems, and the Web client/sever model from the hypertext\\nera to Java on CORBA. Concepts are illustrated using several case\\nstudies of experimental and commercial systems, and discussions on\\nemerging standards.\\n\\nThe course also requires active student participation in a group\\nproject.  Groups of no more than three students will be responsible\\nfor the design and development of a collection of distributed services\\nsuch as data replication, caching, naming, group membership, object\\nsupport and multicast communication.  The group project is intended to\\ncomplement the reading material by allowing the students develop\\nexperimental skills in building distributed protocols.  Each group\\nwill have an opportunity to present its work to the class.\\nPrerequisites:  EECS 482 and graduate standing.\\nText:\\n\\nDistributed Systems by Sape Mullender, Second Edition, 1993.\\n\\nDistributed Operating Systems by Andrew Tanenbaum, 1995.\\n\\nThe essential Client/Server Survival Guide by Orfali et. al.,\\n2nd Edition, 1996.\\n\\nCollection of papers on distributed systems\\nCourse Handouts:\\nCourse Outline\\nHandout 1\\nHandout 2 (part a)\\nHandout 2 (part b)\\nHandout 3 (Group Projects)\\nHandout 4\\nHandout 5 (part a and part b)\\nHandout 6\\nHandout 7 (State Machine and P/B replication-distributed in class)\\nHandout 8 (Multicast Routing-distributed in class)\\nHandout 9 (SRM and RLM-distributed in class)\\nHandout 10 (Weak consistency schemes-distributed in class) (html)\\nHandouts 11 and 12 (distributed in class)\\n\\n\\n\\nfarnam@eecs.umich.eduOctober 1996\\n\\n\"}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.eecs.umich.edu^courses^eecs661^eecs661', 'pagename': 'EECS 661:  Discrete Event Systems', 'content': \"Date: Tue, 26 Nov 1996 19:08:51 GMT\\nServer: Apache/1.1-dev\\nContent-type: text/html\\nSet-Cookie: Apache=gs359343849035331353; path=/\\n\\nEECS 661:  Discrete Event Systems\\nEECS 661:  Discrete Event Systems\\n\\nWelcome to the EECS 661 web page!\\n\\n\\nFor the Fall 1996 offering of this course, this homepage is maintained\\nby the instructor (Professor Stéphane Lafortune),\\nwith the help of John Chay.\\n\\n\\nEECS 661 is offered EVERY OTHER YEAR in the fall semester.\\nIt is intended for EECS graduate students who  want to learn\\nabout the modeling, analysis and control of\\n``discrete event dynamical systems'' (DES).\\nThese are dynamical systems that have discrete state spaces\\nand event-driven dynamics.\\nDES arise in the modeling of technological systems\\nsuch as automated manufacturing systems, computer systems,\\nand communication networks.\\n\\n\\nFuther information is available in the following documents. \\n\\n\\n\\nCourse Information\\n\\nUMDES-LIB User Guide\\n\\nLast Modified: 1996/09/26\\n\"}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www-personal.engin.umich.edu^~brown^Eecs627^index', 'pagename': 'EECS 627 Home Page', 'content': \"Server: Netscape-Commerce/1.12\\nDate: Tuesday, 26-Nov-96 19:09:53 GMT\\nLast-modified: Tuesday, 17-Sep-96 01:27:10 GMT\\nContent-length: 1668\\nContent-type: text/html\\n\\n\\n\\nEECS 627 Home Page\\n\\n\\n\\nEECS 627: VLSI Design II, Winter 1996\\nProf. Richard B.

The course will\\n\\ncover the basic principles of system design, including how various\\n\\ndevices operate and how they can be used to form useful computing\\n\\nsystems. In addition, you will used state-of-the-art design tools\\n\\nin the lab. While this is primarily a hardware class, you will\\n\\nbe expected to write software in 80186 assembly language and to\\n\\nbecome familiar with hardware prototyping tools.\\n\\nGrading Policy \\n\\n\\n1. Labs reports are due one week after the lab work is\\n\\ncomplete at the beginning of your next lab period. Lab hardware\\n\\ndemos are due at the end of lab period ( e.g., the\\n\\nend of the second lab period for a two week lab). The TA, however,\\n\\nmay grant an extension allowing hardware demo any time before\\n\\nyour next lab period ( e.g., if your lab section meets\\n\\nTuesday night, you may demo anytime before 6:30 of the following\\n\\nweek). In this case, you may demo to any TA; the TA will\\n\\nsign a copy of your code listing that you must show to your regular\\n\\nTA. You are responsible for ensuring that the lab is properly\\n\\nrecorded as being complete.\\n\\n\\n\\n2. One lab report per group is sufficient. Each lab will have\\n\\na prelab that is to be turned in beforethe start of that\\n\\nlab. Lab grading will work as follows:\\n\\n\\nPrelab: 5%\\n\\nDemonstration: 45%\\n\\nLab report: 50% \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3. In labs you may work in groups of two. Division of lab work\\n\\nis permitted; however, each student is responsible for fully understanding\\n\\nall aspects of the lab. Your lab TA will quiz you on your understanding\\n\\nof the lab.\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Late labs will be substantially penalized; you will lose\\n\\n30% for each day the lab is late, problems with either CAEN or\\n\\nlab equipment not withstanding. No labs will be collected over\\n\\nweekends or holidays, but you will still be assessed 30% for each\\n\\nday ( i.e., 60% for a weekend). If there is a problem with turning\\n\\nin a lab on time, get in touch with Prof. Birmingham ( and only\\n\\nProf. Birmingham) as soon as possible.\\n\\n\\n4. The honor code is in force on all assignments and exams.\\n\\nThis means that while lab group members may collaborate on lab\\n\\nassignments ( within the bounds specified above), there shall\\n\\nbe no sharing of code or hardware among lab groups. Members of\\n\\nother groups may not help debug hardware or software of other\\n\\ngroups without consent from the TAs or Prof. Birmingham. Furthermore,\\n\\nyou are not allowed to look at the lab reports or code of others\\n\\ngroups, or any past 373 course. Remember, you are under obligation\\n\\nto report any cheating you witness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrading Scheme \\n\\n\\nLab 1: 0%\\n\\n\\nLab 2-8 (each): 10% \\n\\n\\n2 Exams (each): 15% \\n\\n\\n'}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www-personal.engin.umich.edu^~bartlett^f96cxx', 'pagename': 'EECS/CS 284 section 1, Fall 1996', 'content': 'Server: Netscape-Commerce/1.12\\nDate: Tuesday, 26-Nov-96 19:14:10 GMT\\nLast-modified: Thursday, 14-Nov-96 20:52:36 GMT\\nContent-length: 2972\\nContent-type: text/html\\n\\n\\nEECS/CS 284 section 1, Fall 1996\\n\\n\\nEECS/CS 284 section 1\\n\\n On Friday,\\nCentral Campus students put your program under the door of my office\\n1829 East Hall.

Upon completion of the course, the student will be able to design simple digital integrated circuits for a number of technologies (MOS and bipolar) and will be familiar with the use of modern Computer Aided Design Tools. As such he/she will be able to work in a team of designers.\\n1. Contents\\nThe course will start with a detailed description and analysis of the core digital design block, being the inverter. Implementations in CMOS, ECL and BiCMOS design approaches will be discussed. Next the design of more complex combinational gates, such as NAND, NOR and EXORs, will be discussed, looking at optimizing the speed, area or power. The learned techniques will be applied on more evolved designs such as adders and multipliers. The influence of interconnect parasitics on the design performance and approaches to cope with them is treated. Substantial attention is devoted to the discussion of sequential circuits, clocking approaches and memories. The course will be concluded with a discussion of design methodologies. Significant emphasis is placed on the use of CAD Tools (SPICE and MAGIC) for homework, labs and projects.\\n2. Prerequisites\\nEECS 105 (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT!)\\n3. Enrollment\\nDue to classroom-size restrictions and constraints on the lab-equipment, the class enrollment is restricted to 76! The following priority scheme will be used when considering enrollment: 1) graduating seniors; 2) graduate students needing the class for prelim; 3) seniors; 4) juniors. If you don\\'t need the class right away, please consider taking it later (as we are overenrolled at present).\\n4. Course Material\\nA new textbook is in preparation by Professor Rabaey titled \"Digital Integrated Circuits: A Design Perspective.\" \"Unfortunately, the actual book is only now going to press and will not be available until late fall. This text will be made available in the from of a reader from Copy Central on Euclid. Chapters 1-5 will be for sale at the end of the first week of class. Chapters 6 to 11 will be available midway through the semester.\\n5. Assignments\\nThe weekly homework assignments will be handed out in class on Wednesday. They are due the next week before 5pm on Wednesday. They can be returned either in class or deposited in a special box, located in 558 Cory Hall, next to the desk of Corey Schaffer.\\n6. Laboratories: S11 (Tu 3-6pm); S12 (Th 8-11am); S13 (We 11-2pm); S14(Th 3-6pm)\\nThe Laboratories are divided into Software Laboratories, to be performed on workstations, located in 111 Cory Hall and Hardware Laboratories, located in 353 Cory Hall. The software and hardware materials will be available from Copy Central the second week of class. The first lab is the second week of the semester and is on the MAGIC layout system.\\n7.

Each type of multimedia data has different properties.\\nFor example, the bandwidth required for CD quality audio is very different\\nfrom that required for full motion video, which is different from that\\nof plain text.  However, a property common to all of these data types is\\nthat they are all real-time in nature.  The applications send stream of\\ndata that must be used within a time interval because the data is useless\\nafter that interval.  Optimal scheduling of real-time tasks on distributed\\nand multiprocessor systems is an essential issue for multimedia applications.\\n\\n\\nThe objective of this seminar is to study the basic properties and\\ntechniques for real-time system support for multimedia application.\\nWe will study and present research papers in this area.  Topics\\ninclude real-time scheduling, causal message ordering, multiprocessor\\nreal-time systems, etc.\\n\\nPapers\\n\\n\\nJ.

These include:\\n global states (cuts, logical and vector clocks, causal message\\ndelivery, global property detection)\\n message logging and checkpointing\\n replication management (state machine approach, primary backup\\napproach)\\n agreement protocols (Byzantine agreement, ordered multicast)\\n group programming (techniques and applications)\\n distributed file systems (caching, disconnected operations)\\n time services (Byzantine clock synchronization, NTP)\\n security (encryption, authentication, security in group programming)\\n\\n\\nWe will integrate the discussion of the general principles with the\\npresentation of case studies that exemplify how such principles\\nhave been used to design and implement  real systems.\\nOther topics, depending on time and interest, will be presented by me\\nor by some of you (the size of the class does not allow all of you to give a\\npresentation). Such topics  may include:\\n distributed shared memory\\n distributed objects\\n kernel support for distributed systems\\n weak consistency for replica management\\n protocols for electronic commerce\\n protocols for wide-area networks\\n\\n\\nGrading\\n\\nThere will be 4 or 5 written homework assignment. Solutions will be\\ngraded F, B, or A. Any solution that demonstrates a credible effort on\\nbehalf of its authors (whether the solution is right or wrong) will\\nreceive a B or better.\\n\\nCollaboration on homework assignment by up to three students is\\npermitted and encouraged, but not required. When there is such a\\ncollaboration, a single solution should be submitted for\\ngrading, with the names of the collaborators. Other collaborations\\nwill be considered violations of Academic Integrity.\\n\\nThere will be a written, take-home midterm examination, for which no\\ncollaboration will be allowed.\\n\\nThere will be no final exam. Each student however will be required to\\nwrite a final paper (about 20 pages) that surveys one of the issues\\nthat we have discussed in class. A list of suggested topics will be\\ndistributed in class on Monday 4/8. The paper is due at the start of\\nthe last class, Wednesday 5/1: hence, you will have 4 weeks to\\ncomplete the paper.\\n\\nYou can also team up with a colleague and prepare one or two\\nlectures on a topic not previously covered in class. If you choose\\nthis option, you and your colleague will only be required to write a\\nsingle survey paper of about 20 pages. I warmly encourage you to\\nconsider volunteering for a presentation: it will give you an excellent\\nopportunity to improve your communication skills.\\n\\n\\nProblem Sets\\n\\nIn this and all subsequent problem sets, you should\\nconform to the following general guidelines:\\n ``Prove'' and ``show'' are synonymous. A precise proof is\\nrequired when you are asked to ``prove'' or ``show'' something.\\n To show that something is impossible, you have to give a proof that\\nmakes it clear that the problem cannot be solved, no matter what the algorithm\\nis. It is insufficient to show that a particular algorithm does not work.\\n Any algorithm that you develop must be accompanied by a proof of\\ncorrectness, unless you explicitly told otherwise.\\n\\n\\n\\n Due: Mon, 5 Feb 1996\\nProblem 1\\n The snapshot protocols discussed in class and in the\\ntextbook assume that communication channels are FIFO. Derive a\\nsnapshot protocol for an asynchronous system that does not depend on\\nthe FIFO assumption, and prove it correct (i.e. prove that the\\nprotocol produces a consistent global state). You may assume that at\\nmost one snapshot is being computed at any point during a run. \\n Note: The book contains a reference to a paper by Mattern that\\ncontains a solution to the problem. I urge you to resist the\\ntemptation to solve the problem by visiting the library...\\n\\nProblem 2\\n Taking the snapshot of a distributed computation is a\\ngeneral technique for computing stable global predicates. More\\nefficient protocols can be derived for computing specific predicates,\\nthat are often conceptually simpler and more efficient (in terms of\\nthe number of messages they exchange) than a snapshot-based solution.\\n\\nIn this problem you are required to derive such a ``specialized''\\nprotocol for detecting a deadlock in an asynchronous distributed\\nsystem. Ideally, your protocol would not need a centralized monitor\\nprocess, and would have a message cost of O(n), where n\\nis the number of processes in the distributed system (a monitor-based\\nsnapshot protocol for detecting deadlock has a cost of O(n*n)).\\n\\nThe suggested solutions to these problems are now\\nonline.

We use\\nthe Dylan language, an object oriented dynamic language developed\\nat Apple Computer, which is well suited for covering a broad range\\nof introductory computer science topics.  This is not a course\\nabout the Dylan language, it just happens to be the \"notation\"\\nthat we have chosen for writing programs.  The major goals of\\nthe course are to teach students how to think clearly about programs\\nand programming, and to provide a toolbox of modern programming\\ntechniques that will be applicable in any language. \\n\\nWhat course to take: Students often wonder whether to take\\nCS211 or CS212.  CS211 focuses on programming skills in the object-oriented\\nlanguage Java, whereas CS212 provides exposure to a broad range\\nof computational and programming problems, using a number of programming\\nparadigms including functional, object-oriented and imperative\\nprogramming techniques.  If you have a good CS background or good\\nformal skills (e.g., mathematics or physics) you should probably\\ntake CS212. Transfers between CS211 and CS212 (in either direction)\\nare encouraged during the first two weeks.\\n\\nReaching Us \\n\\n\\nThe best way to reach the course staff is by posting questions\\nor comments using the CS212 Web site http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Courses/Current/CS212/\\n This site contains all course materials, and runs a CoNote server\\nwhich allows students and staff to post questions and answers\\nas \"annotations\" to the handouts and problem sets. \\nIn order to access the Web site you will need to request a user-id\\nand password for the CoNote system.  To do this, simply go to\\nthe CS212 home page and follow the instructions.  Your user-id\\nand password will be created by Monday if you request them this\\nweek.\\n\\nYou can also reach the course staff is by sending email to cs212@cs.cornell.edu\\nbut this should not be used for asking questions about\\nproblem sets or handouts (use the Web site).\\n\\n\\nWho We Are\\n\\n\\nDan Huttenlocher, Professor, 4119 Upson \\n\\nTobias Mayr, TA, 5148 Upson\\n\\nJames Hamblin, ugrad TA\\n\\nRobert Szewczyk, ugrad TA\\n\\nJustin Voskuhl, ugrad TA\\n\\nAndras Ferencz, consultant\\n\\n Melissa Ho, consultant\\n\\nWhen We Meet\\n\\n\\nLectures are Tuesday and Thursday at 10:10, in B11 Kimball and\\nrecitations are Monday and Wednesday at 1:25, 2:30 or 3:35.  Recitations\\nexpand on the material in lecture, and provide more opportunity\\nto ask questions.\\n\\n\\nConsulting hours, for help with problem sets or other questions,\\nwill be held from 7pm until midnight the two evenings before each\\nproblem set is due (see schedule below).  Thus for problem sets\\ndue on a Tuesday there will be consulting hours Sunday and Monday\\nevenings and for those due on a Thursday there will be consulting\\nhours Tuesday and Wednesday evenings. Consulting hours are in\\nthe public Mac lab in B7 Upson.\\n\\nOffice hours are: James Hamblin TBA, Dan Huttenlocher T 1:00-2:00,\\nTobias Mayr F 12:15-1:15, Robert Szewczyk TBA, Justin Voskuhl\\nTBA.\\n\\nCourse Materials\\n\\n\\nThere is no textbook for this course.  There will be course handouts\\nand lecture notes, which will be available both in hardcopy and\\non the course Web site.\\n\\nThe Dylan interpreter is available free on the course Web site,\\nand was developed by Justin Voskuhl for this class.  It is implemented\\nin Java, and thus will run under any Java capable Web browser.\\n The best current browser (it changes almost weekly) is Netscape\\n3.0 for Windows95/NT, which has Borland\\'s just-in-time Java compiler.\\n There are also standalone versions available that you can download\\nonto your computer if you do not want to use the Web browser version.\\n One word of warning: if you download a standalone Dylan onto\\nyour machine, make sure that you are using the most recent\\nversion by checking the web site.\\n\\nCourse Requirements\\n\\n\\nStudents are responsible for all material in the assigned readings,\\nas well as that covered in lectures and in recitations.  There\\nwill be six problem sets, two preliminary exams, and a final exam\\n(a schedule is given below).  Each problem set will be a combination\\nof written exercises and a programming assignment.  Course grades\\nwill be based on a combination of the problem sets and exam scores.\\n The problem sets will account for approximately one half of the\\ntotal grade. No late assignments will be accepted (we will\\ngenerally grade assignments immediately and return them the following\\nclass period).\\n\\nYou should try to complete the programming assignments early,\\nas we will not accept late work. The best use of your time and\\nthe machine\\'s time is to think about the problems before sitting\\ndown at the computer. [No matter how many times we say this,\\nit takes a long time to sink in; think about the problems before\\nsitting down at the computer.]\\n\\nPolicy on Joint Work\\n\\n\\nMuch of the learning in this course comes from doing the programming\\nproblems.  You may work jointly with one other person on the assignments\\n(no more than two people should work together).  However, if you\\nwork together with someone, you must submit a single joint\\nassignment with both names on it.  Under no circumstances\\nmay you hand in work done with (or by) someone else under your\\nown name.  If in doubt, credit the person(s) from whom you\\ngot help.  You would be amazed at how easy it is to tell when\\npeople work together on problem sets, so please don\\'t make life\\nunpleasant for all of us by breaking these rules.\\n\\nPublic Lab Facilities\\n\\n\\nCIT and various colleges on campus provide public Macintosh and\\nPC facilities, you may use your own machine or the public ones.\\n The CS department does not provide computer facilities for this\\ncourse. The course consultants will be available in the B7 Upson\\nMac lab (see above).\\n\\nProblem Set Due Dates and Exam Dates\\n\\n\\nAll problem sets are due before 2am on the due date.  For example,\\nan assignment due Tuesday must be submitted electronically to\\nthe course server by 2am on Tuesday (that is late Monday\\nnight).  No late assignments are accepted, so make sure you submit\\nyour final solution by the correct time and date.\\n\\n[9/12] Assignment 1 \\n\\n[9/24] Assignment 2 \\n\\n[10/8] Assignment 3 \\n\\n[10/17] Prelim 1, 7:30pm \\n\\n[10/29] Assignment 4 \\n\\n[11/12] Assignment 5 \\n\\n[11/19] Prelim 2, 7:30pm \\n\\n[12/5] Assignment 6 \\n\\n[12/19] Final Exam -- see exam schedule \\n\\n\\nLecture Outline \\n\\n [8/29] The Study of Computation, and an Introduction to Dylan\\n\\n\\n [9/3] Function Abstraction and the Substitution Model of Evaluation\\n\\n\\n [9/5] Procedures and Processes: Iteration, Recursion and Induction\\n\\n\\n [9/10] Higher Order Procedures: Functional Arguments and Values\\n\\n\\n [9/12] Analysis of Algorithms: Orders of Growth \\n\\n [9/17] Data Abstraction: Structures, Contracts and Implementations\\n\\n\\n [9/19] Hierarchical Data: Lists, Trees and the need for Quotation\\n\\n\\n [9/24] Recursive List Processing and Reasoning about Lists \\n\\n [9/26] Symbolic Differentiation: An Extended Example \\n\\n [10/1] Generic Operations: Type Dispatching and Generic Functions\\n\\n\\n [10/3] Generic Operations: Polynomial Arithmetic System \\n\\n [10/8] Assignment and the Environment Model of Evaluation \\n\\n [10/10] Assignment and Local State Variables \\n\\n [10/17] Objects with State and Object Oriented Programming \\n\\n [10/22] Object Oriented Programming and Inheritance \\n\\n [10/24] Multimethods and More About Object Oriented Programming\\n\\n [10/29] Mutable Data: Stacks and Queues\\n\\n [10/31] Mutable Data: Heaps, Heapsort and Priority Queues\\n\\n [11/5] The Metacircular Evaluator: Dylan in Dylan\\n\\n [11/7] Variations on Expression Evaluation\\n\\n [11/12] Compilation and Optimization\\n\\n [11/14] Streams \\n\\n [11/19] Infinite Streams\\n\\n [11/21] Nonlocal Exits: Catch and Throw\\n\\n [11/26] Garbage Collection and the Illusion of Infinite Memory\\n\\n [12/3] Topics in CS: Randomization and Quicksort \\n\\n [12/5] Topics in CS: Computability \\n\\n\\n'}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cs.cornell.edu^Info^People^mhr^681^681', 'pagename': 'CS 681  Fall 1995', 'content': \"MIME-Version: 1.0\\nServer: CERN/3.0\\nDate: Sunday, 24-Nov-96 22:21:07 GMT\\nContent-Type: text/html\\nContent-Length: 3278\\nLast-Modified: Monday, 30-Oct-95 01:33:44 GMT\\n\\n\\nCS 681  Fall 1995\\nCS 681 Fall 1995\\nProfessor:  Monika Rauch Henzinger\\n\\nEmail: mhr@cs.cornell.edu\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Course Information\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHomeworks:  1\\n 2\\n 3\\n 4\\n 5\\n 6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSolutions:  1\\n 2\\n 3\\n 4\\n 5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLectures: \\n\\n Lecture 1: Graph Exploration\\n\\n\\n Lecture 2: Greedy Algorithms\\n\\n\\n Lecture 3: Matroids\\n\\n\\n Lecture 4: Matroids\\n\\n\\n Lecture 5: Dijkstra's Algorithm\\n\\n\\n Lecture 6: Bellman-Ford's Algorithm\\n\\n\\n Lecture 7: Matrix Closure\\n\\n\\n Lecture 8: \\nBinomial Heaps\\n\\n\\n Lecture 9: \\nBinomial Heaps\\n\\n\\n Lecture 10: \\nFibonacci Heaps\\n\\n\\n Lecture 11: Treaps\\n\\n\\n Lecture 12: Randomized\\nSearch Trees\\n\\n\\n Lecture 13: \\nUnion-Find\\n\\n\\n Lecture 14: \\nUnion-Find\\n\\n\\n Lecture 15: \\nUnion-Find\\n\\n\\n Lecture 16: \\nMaxFlow\\n\\n\\n Lecture 17: \\nMaxFlow MinCut Theorem\\n\\n\\n Lecture 18: \\nMaxFlow: Edmonds-Karp Algorithms\\n\\n\\n Lecture 19: \\nMaxFlow: Dinitz'Algorithm\\n\\n\\n Lecture 20: \\nMaxFlow: Preflow Push\\n\\n\\n Lecture 21: \\nMaxFlow: Preflow Push\\n\\n\\n Lecture 22: \\nMaxFlow: Dynamic Tree Implementations\\n\\n\\n\"}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cs.cornell.edu^Info^Courses^Spring-96^CS100^CS100', 'pagename': 'CS100 Home Page Spring 1996', 'content': 'MIME-Version: 1.0\\nServer: CERN/3.0\\nDate: Sunday, 24-Nov-96 22:03:12 GMT\\nContent-Type: text/html\\nContent-Length: 1679\\nLast-Modified: Friday, 19-Apr-96 20:53:08 GMT\\n\\n\\n\\n CS100 Home Page Spring 1996 \\n\\n\\n\\n CS100 Home Page \\n Spring 1996 \\n\\n\\n Message of the Day \\n\\nWelcome to the CS100 Home Page.

Topics include process\\nsynchronization, deadlock, memory management, input-output methods,\\ninformation sharing, protection and security, and file systems.  The\\nimpact of network and distributed computing environments on operating\\nsystems is also discussed. This is a fast-paced subject requiring\\nconstant attention.\\n1.1 Prerequsites\\n\\nComplete familiarity with the material of CS314 is assumed. In\\nparticular, a knowledge of computer architecture, assembly programming\\nlanguage and program structure is required. I'll cover some of the\\nintroductory material in class as required, but the purpose of that\\nwill be to remind the audience of the material.\\n\\n1.2 Course Outline\\n\\nThe course will be organized roughly as follows. I say roughly,\\nbecause depending on the feedback from the class, I may change the\\norder or the content of particular sections.\\n\\n We'll start off with an overview of concurrency issues. We'll\\ndiscuss synchronization issues - in particular, ensuring mutual\\nexclusion, deadlock detections and prevention algorithms. We'll\\ndiscuss multiprocessor issues as well. Next, we'll go on to memory\\nmanagement. Here we'll discuss virtual memory and various methods used\\nto implement virtual memory, such as paging and segmentation. Next,\\nwe'll cover file systems. Finally, we'll look at evolution of the\\ntraditional operating systems and look at micro-kernels. If time\\npermits, we'll have a few lectures on advanced topics such as multi\\nthreading and serverless file systems.\\n\\n1.3 Textbooks\\n\\nThe principal text book for the class is the Operating System Concepts\\nbook by Abraham Silberschatz and Peter Galvin. I'll also distribute\\nclass notes which will cover the material completely. The class notes\\nwill also be available on the world wide web from the class home page\\nat the end of each class.\\n\\n2 Course Schedule   We will meet Monday\\nthru Thursday from 10:00AM-11:15AM during the weeks of 7/8 -\\n8/16. There will be two in-class quizzes. The first will be on 7/18\\nand the second will be on 8/1. The final will be on 8/16. In addition,\\nthere will be weekly assignments for the first 5 weeks of class. These\\nwill be handed out on Thursday and will be due the following Thursday\\nat the start of the class.  \\n3 Quizzes & Grading\\n\\nEach of the homeworks will carry a weightage of 6% for a combined\\nweightage of 30%. The final will be worth 40% and there will be two\\nmidterms worth 15% each.

Emphasis is on \\ntechniques of problem analysis and the development of algorithms and programs.\\nThe subject of the course is programming, not a particular programming \\nlanguage. The principal programming language is C. The course does not presume\\nprevious programming experience. Programming assignments are tested and run on\\ninteractive, stand-alone microcomputers. \\n\\n\\nAlternative version of COM S 100, emphasizing examples and applications \\ninvolving continuous mathematics, including trigonometry and calculus. \\n\\n\\nCS100B vs. CS100A\\n\\n\\nComputer Science 100b basically teaches the same material as CS100a. There are\\na some differences, though (besides the last letter). CS100b assumes the\\nknowledge and/or familiarity with continuous math (as opposed to discrete one),\\nincluding trigonometry and calculus. One might wonder what that means in a \\nprogramming course. Well, computer science and math interact in many ways and \\nCS100b  introduces one of them - scientific computing. This does not mean that \\nCS100a is `easier' than CS100b. It means that if you think you are comfortable\\nwith integrals, derivatives, etc., CS100b will show you ways of applying your \\nknowledge to computer programming. The point of it is not necessarily to \\ntest that knowledge, but rather expand it and apply it. I would \\nlike to encourage people who think they would \\nqualify to take this course. Continuous math might not sound that attractive, \\nbut  you can only benefit with this choice. It is often hard to find good \\nexamples of `real world' problems in an intro course for CS, but CS100b finds\\none. If you are not sure whether you `qualify', please talk to the instructor \\n(Prof. Zabih), and ask him for an opinion.\\n\\n\\nBesides that, there is a slight difference in the topics taught in 100b and \\n100a (although, for the most part they coincide one with another). If you \\nalready know a bit about C, CS100b will spend some more time on pointers and\\nthe model of the language itself. If you don't know what this means, it doesn't \\nmatter - just disregard the last sentence.\\n\\n\\n\\nGrading  Policies\\n\\n\\nGrades for CS100B will be computed as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCS100B course grades\\nPrograms20%\\nPrelim 110%\\nPrelim 220%\\nPrelim 320%\\nFinal \\t30%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGraded assignments and exams will be returned in sections. You\\ncan pick up the unclaimed assignments/exams from a consultant in Carpenter, \\nprovided you have an ID with you.\\n\\n\\nRegrades: If you feel an exam or a program has been incorrectly graded,\\nfill out a regrade request giving your reasons in writing, attach the exam to \\nit, and give it to the consultant in the Carpenter lab. A regrade request can\\ncause your grade to go up or down - the paper will be regraded from \\nscratch. \\nA regrade must be submited within one week after the graded work has \\nbeen returned.\\n\\n\\nPosted Grades: Grades will be posted outside the Carpenter lab by either\\nsrudent ID# or a four-digit code that you give us. It is your \\nresponibility to verify that our records are correct. If you find an error,\\nplease contact the course administrator, Laurie Buck (but please, only during \\nher office hours). \\nNote: since an error in our records can occur, you\\nshould probably keep your graded assignments/exams until you double-checked \\nyour grade with the posted one.\\n\\n\\n\\nExam Schedule \\n\\n\\n\\nExam times\\nExamDateTimeLocation\\nPrelim 1Mon., September 307:30 p.m.TBA\\nPrelim 2Tue., October 227:30 p.m.TBA\\nPrelim 3Tue., November 197:30 p.m. A-L Kimball B11; M-Z Upson B17\\nFinal Tue., December 179:00 a.m.TBA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: CS100B will cover different material than CS100A.

It is intended\\nto give students a solid background in the design and development of database\\nmanagement systems (DBMS\\'s). Database systems are possibly the world\\'s\\nlargest pieces of software, and certainly among the most valuable pieces\\nof software. While a DBMS is in one sense a giant application program,\\nthere are surprisingly many principles behind its development and use.\\nThe database industry is growing and thriving, and the demand for knowledgeable\\ndatabase engineers is much greater than the supply. The database research\\ncommunity is also active, and there are always new problems to be addressed\\nbecause of the explosive amounts of data that people wish to access. This\\ncourse forms essential background for anyone who wants to (a) become a\\nsystems engineer at a database development company, or (b) become an informed\\nuser of database systems, or (c) become a database systems researcher,\\nor (d) develop systems in any domain that manipulate large amounts of data,\\nor (e) find out how a teller machine really works! \\nA number of \"advanced fundamental\" DBMS concepts will be covered.\\nAlthough this is not intended to be an introductory course, it is a new\\ncourse and there may be students in the class with different backgrounds.\\nConsequently, the discussion of various topics will begin with a quick\\nreview of basic material taught in CS 432. Click here\\nfor a tentative list of topics to be covered. \\nIn terms of workload, here\\'s what the course involves: \\n\\nThere will be a midterm and a final examination. These will test a\\nbreadth of basic concepts. \\nEach student will have to do a survey paper on a specific advanced\\ntopic. Here is a list of possible topics. The\\npurpose of this is to be aware that what is being taught in the course\\nis only a fraction of what is out there. This paper will be due three weeks\\nafter the midterm, and should be complete with references. It will require\\nreading papers from journals and conference proceedings in the engineering\\nlibrary. I will suggest initial references, and you will have to pursue\\nadditional references from there. Click here for\\ninformation on reference material in the library. \\nA development project involving C++ programming. Look here\\nfor more information. \\nThere will be no written homework assignments. \\nStudents take turns writing lecture notes. Depending on enrollment,\\nthis means each person will have to take notes once or twice in the semester.\\nHopefully, this additional work will turn out to be useful around exam\\ntime. Here are the details (in .ps).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Development\\nProject \\nThe term project is an important part of the course, and will involve\\na significant amount of C++ programming. You can choose whether you wish\\nto work alone or in teams of two. However, the two-person projects will\\ninvolve proportionally more work. The goal of the project is two-fold:\\n(a) to get hands-on experience at building some specific DBMS component,\\n(b) to get comfortable working with a large pre-existing code-base, and\\nmodifying it in a modular manner. The second goal is as important as the\\nfirst one, because all database systems are huge software systems, and\\nrarely do you have the luxury of starting from scratch. This forces you\\nto write modular code, and also to understand the interaction between the\\ndifferent system components when the inevitable bugs appear. \\nThere are two research DBMS prototypes that will be used in the projects.\\nOne is MINIBASE, which is software associated with the textbook. It is\\na simple single-user database system that provides all the components from\\nthe SQL parser down to the disk manager. This should hopefully be available,\\ndepending on our being able to compile and run it in our computing environment.\\nThe important part of MINIBASE is the interface description of the various\\nsystem components. The actual code comes from class projects. Consequently,\\nprojects using MINIBASE will involve writing a component (like the buffer\\nmanager), based on a specification of its C++ interface. \\nThe other prototype is PREDATOR, which is a query processing engine\\nthat I have been developing for my research. There are a number of possible\\nprojects (some of which could lead to research topics) that can be built\\non top of PREDATOR. The focus here is on the high-end functionality like\\ncomplex queries and new data types. \\nIf you are not familiar with C++, I recommend a MINIBASE project because\\nthe amount of design needed is minimal. If you think you are interested\\nin database systems research, then you should do a PREDATOR project. If\\nyou fall in neither category, then you should decide whether you want a\\nproject at the lower-level DBMS (storage, access, buffer) areas, or the\\nhigher-level (query processing, optimization) areas and choose between\\nMINIBASE (lower-level) and PREDATOR (higher-level). There are also some\\ngeneral projects that involve neither system. If you have your own idea\\non a suitable project, you should talk with me about it well in advance\\nof the project proposal date. \\nHere is a tentative list of possible projects.\\nIn all the projects, there will be certain steps that should be followed:\\n\\n\\nAs part of the project proposal, you should (discuss with me) and submit\\nan ordered list of pieces of functionality that the project will produce.\\n\\nThere will be a mid-project review in which you meet with me to discuss\\nthe progress that you have made towards completing the project. \\nThe code you write must follow the coding conventions of the particular\\nsystem that you are working on. A detailed coding conventions document\\nwill be provided and should be followed closely. This is something that\\nI will be very picky on, and that will contribute to the grade you get\\non the project. \\nProject submission should include a demo and a reasonable amount of\\ntest data. \\n\\nSome useful references are: \\n\\nHome page for PREDATOR. \\nHome\\npage for MINIBASE. \\n\\n\\n\\n Course\\nTextBook \\nThe primary text is a beta edition of a new book on database systems\\n: \"Database Management Systems\" by Raghu Ramakrishnan. This book\\ncontains many more details than are in most other introductory database\\nbooks. It is also associated with free software for an instructional database\\nsystem \"MINIBASE\",\\nwhich we might use in class assignments. The textbook is available in the\\ncampus store for $46. Here are other textbooks which could be used as references:\\n\\n\\nKorth & Silberschatz: Database System Concepts. McGraw-Hill, Second\\nEdition, 1991. \\nThis is the standard introductory database text, but lacks the detail to\\nbe used in a graduate course. \\nMichael Stonebraker: Readings in Database Systems. Morgan Kaufmann,\\nSecond Edition, 1994.\\nThis is a collection of relatively recent papers in the area, collected\\nand introduced by Stonebraker, who developed the Ingres, Postgres, and\\nIllustra database systems.

It will be set to be comfortably finished in 1.5 hrs, but an\\nextra half hour will be provided for those who need it. Likewise for the\\nfinal exam. The final should be in exam period 16 (Thurs., Dec 19 9:00-11:30am),\\nbut this again is tentative and needs to be confirmed. The final exam will\\nfocus on material not tested in the mid-term, but the material covered\\nin the earlier part of the course may form background for some of the questions.\\n\\n\\n Professor\\n\\n\\nPraveen Seshadri\\n\\n        Office:        4108 Upson\\n        Phone:         255-1045\\n        E-Mail:        praveen@cs\\n        Office Hours:  10:00 -- 11:00 AM, Tuesday and Thursday\\n\\n Teaching\\nAssistants \\n\\nWei\\nTsang Ooi \\n        Office:        5162 Upson Hall\\n        Phone:         5-7421\\n        E-Mail:        weitsang@cs\\n        Office Hours:  MWF 11:00 AM -- 12:00 noon \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'}\n","{'id': 'http_^^www.cs.cornell.edu^Info^Courses^Current^CS631^home', 'pagename': 'CS 631 Home Page', 'content': \"MIME-Version: 1.0\\nServer: CERN/3.0\\nDate: Wednesday, 20-Nov-96 20:17:30 GMT\\nContent-Type: text/html\\nContent-Length: 1051\\nLast-Modified: Tuesday, 22-Oct-96 02:11:39 GMT\\n\\n\\nCS 631 Home Page\\n\\n\\nCS631\\nMultimedia Systems\\nComputer Science Department\\n Cornell University\\n Fall 1996 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Course Staff\\n Course Info\\n Course Materials\\n Students' Web Pages\\n Project Web Pages\\n Some useful links\\n 631 Newsgroup\\n Anouncements \\n\\n Newsgroup Access \\n Rivl bug\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nComments or questions about this web page?

The goal\\nof this course is not to conduct a broad survey of hi-tech programming\\nlanguages like C++, Java, or SML, nor to directly study implementation \\nmechanisms for these languages (e.g., compressed dispatch tables for multiple\\ninheritance).  Rather, the goal of this course is to study \\nthe principles\\nof formal notation for describing computations, and tools for analyzing \\nand proving properties of computations.  These concerns subsume the\\nstudy of specific programming languages or implementation mechanisms \\nand hence lead to a deeper understanding of programming, specification,\\nlogic, mathematics, and proof theory.  \\n\\nFor example, we will study notations for abstractly specifying how\\nprograms compute (operational semantics), as well as\\nnotations for describing what programs compute \\n(denotational semantics).  In turn, the abstract but precise\\nrealization of these notations will allow us to study techniques \\n(induction, logical relations) for\\nformally proving interesting and relevant properties of \\nprogramming languages (e.g., type safety or compiler correctness).  \\n\\nIdeally, a student coming out of this course will have learned something\\nabout how to make informal concepts and notation precise, and how to\\nmanipulate the notation to demonstrate useful properties.  \\n\\n Textbooks: \\n\\n\\n  Semantics of Programming Languages ,  Carl A. Gunter.\\n  ML for the Working Programmer (Second Edition) , Larry Paulson.\\n\\n Prerequisites: \\n\\nOn the programming side, \\nwe assume experience with at least a Pascal- or C-like language.\\nPreferably, students will have some knowledge and experience working with\\na functional language, such as Scheme, ML, or Haskell.  \\n\\nOn the theoretical side, we assume a basic proficiency in undergraduate\\nmathematics, logic, and computer science.  A basic knowledge of \\ncomputability (e.g., turing machines, recursive functions) and\\nlogic (e.g., predicate calculus), as well as some mathematical\\nmaturity is required.  \\n\\nThis course is designed for PhD students in CS, Math,\\nOR, and EE.  It is not for MEng or undergraduate students.  If you are an\\nMEng or undergraduate student, you must talk to the instructor to find out if\\nthe course is suitable for you.  \\n\\n\\n Contact Information: \\n\\n Newsgroup: cornell.class.cs611\\n\\n\\n\\n Instructor: Greg Morrisett, Upson 4105C, jgm@cs.cornell.edu, 5-3009\\n Office Hours:  MF after class or by appointment.\\n Admin.
